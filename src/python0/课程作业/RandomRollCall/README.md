# RandomRollCall

This is a simple app that randomly selects a student from a list of students.

---

If u want to build it, it's recommended to use **pyinstaller**.

```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
cd src/RandomRollCall
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon/TChub.ico RandomRollCall.py
```

Then u can get an executable file in the `dist` folder.
