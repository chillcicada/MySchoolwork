      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfred Elton van Vogt''' ([[Winnipeg]], [[Canada]], [[April 26]], [[1912]] - [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|USA]], [[January 26]], [[2000]]) was a renowned [[Canada|Canadian]]-born [[science fiction author]] widely regarded as one of the most prolific, yet complex, writers from the mid-twentieth century '[[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]]' of the genre.

==Science Fiction's Golden Age==

Van Vogt was one of the most popular and highly esteemed science fiction writers of the [[1940s]], during the ascent of the genre's Golden Age. After starting his writing career by writing for 'true confession' style [[pulp magazines]] like ''True Story'', van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, [[science fiction]].

Van Vogt's first published SF story, &quot;Black Destroyer&quot; (''[[Analog Science Fiction|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', [[July]] [[1939]]), was inspired by ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]]. The story depicted a fierce, carnivorous [[Extraterrestrial_life|alien]] stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. It was the cover story of the issue of ''Astounding'' which ushered in the Golden Age of science fiction. The story became an instant classic and eventually served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies. In 1950 it was combined with &quot;War of Nerves&quot; ([[1950]]), &quot;Discord in Scarlet&quot; (1939) and &quot;M33 in Andromeda&quot; ([[1943]]) to form the novel ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' ([[1950]])

Many fans of that era would have named van Vogt, [[Robert A. Heinlein]], and [[Isaac Asimov]] as the three greatest science fiction writers.

In [[1941]] van Vogt decided to become a full time writer, quitting his job at the Canadian Department of National Defence.  Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of [[short stories]]. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or &quot;[[fixup|fixups]]&quot; as he called them, a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism. Sometimes this was successful (''[[The War against the Rull]]'') while other times the disparate stories thrown together made for a less coherent plot (''[[Quest for the Future]]'').

One of van Vogt's best novels of this period is ''[[Slan]]'', which appeared in ''Astounding Sicence Fiction'' in [[1940]]. Using what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old [[superman]] living in a world in which his kind are slain by [[Homo sapiens]].

==A post-war philosopher== 

In [[1944]], van Vogt moved to [[Hollywood, California]], where his writing took on new dimensions after [[World War II]].  Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern [[meta-systems]]), the characters in his very first story used a system called 'Nexialism' to analyze the alien's behaviour, and he became interested in the [[General Semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]].  And he was profoundly affected by revelations of [[totalitarian]] [[police state|police states]] that emerged after [[World War II]].  He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist [[China]], ''The Angry Man'' ([[1962]]); he said that prior to this he had read 100 books about China.

He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' and ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'' in the late [[1940s]], and ''[[Null-A Three]]'' in the early [[1980s]].  ''Null-A'', or [[non-Aristotelian logic]], refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using [[intuitive]], inductive reasoning ([[fuzzy logic]]), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, deductive logic.

[[Image:Linn.jpg|thumb|220px|First edition of ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' ([[1956]])]]

Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved.  Several of his stories hinge upon temporal [[Conundrum|conundrums]], a favorite theme.  He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from books on writing by [[Thomas Uzzell]].

He said many of his ideas came from dreams, and indeed his stories at times had the incoherence of dreams, but at their best, as in the fantasy novel ''[[The Book of Ptath]]'', his works had all the vision and power a dream can impart.  Throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.

In the [[1950s]], van Vogt briefly became involved in [[L. Ron Hubbard|L. Ron Hubbard's]] [[Dianetics]].  Van Vogt operated a storefront, for the secular precursor to Hubbard's [[Scientology]] [[sect]], in the [[Los Angeles]] area for a time, before winding up at odds with Hubbard and his methods.  His writing more or less stopped for some years, a period in which he bitterly claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by Hubbard's followers.  In this period he limited to collect old short stories to form notable [[fixup|fixups]] like: ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' ([[1952]]), ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' ([[1959]]), ''[[The Beast]]'' ([[1963]]) and the two novels of the &quot;Linn&quot; cyle, which were inspired by fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. He resumed writing again in the [[1960s]], mainly through [[Frederik Pohl]]'s invitation, while remaining in Hollywood with his second wife, Lydia Bereginsky, who took care of him through his declining years. In this period his stories were born since the very beginning as whole novels, but in general show van Vogt's difficulties in keeping pace with the evolution of science fiction.

==Recognition==

In [[1946]], van Vogt and his first wife, [[Edna Mayne Hull]], were co-Guests of Honor at the fourth [[World Science Fiction Convention]], 

In [[1980]], van Vogt received a &quot;Casper Award&quot; (precursor to the Canadian [[Aurora Award]]s) for Lifetime Achievement. In [[1995]] he was awarded the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]].  In [[1996]], van Vogt was recognized on two occasions: the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] presented him with a Special Award ''for six decades of golden age science fiction'', and the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] included him among its initial four inductees.

===Critical praise===

Famous science fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] has said that van Vogt's stories spurred his interest in science fiction with their strange sense of the unexplained, that something more was going on than the protagonists realized.

In a review of ''Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt'', science fiction writer [[Paul Di Filippo]] said:

:''Van Vogt knew precisely what he was doing in all areas of his fiction writing. There's hardly a wasted word in his stories... His plots are marvels of interlocking pieces, often ending in real surprises and shocks, genuine paradigm shifts, which are among the hardest conceptions to depict.  And the intellectual material of his fictions, the conceits and tossed-off observations on culture and human and alien behavior, reflect a probing mind...Each tale contains a new angle, a unique slant, that makes it stand out.'' &lt;br&gt; (DiFilippo, Paul, (2003) ''[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/books2.html Off The Shelf]'', Retrieved [[9 January]] [[2003]]).

===Criticism===

Van Vogt's style has been criticized as confused and incoherent. Writer and critic [[Damon Knight]] wrote in [[1945]] that &quot;van Vogt is not a giant as often mantained. He's only a pygmy using a giant typewriter&quot;.

His technical knowledge seems questionable.  Examples:

*In ''Cosmic Encounter'', one result of the crash of an alien spaceship is the generation of a temperature of minus 50,000 degrees, well below [[absolute zero]].
*The title of his story collection ''M33 in Andromeda'' is incorrect; M33 is in [[Triangulum]], M31 (the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]) is in [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]].
*The popular short story ''Vault of the Beast'' hinges on the concept of the largest [[prime number]]; it was demonstrated as far back as [[Ancient Greece]] that the series of primes is infinite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anna Kournikova.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Anna Kournikova on the cover of [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'' magazine]] in 2004.]]
'''Anna Sergeyevna Kournikova''' ([[Russian (language)|Russian]]: '''Анна Сергеевна Курникова''', ''Ánna Sergéyevna Kúrnikova;'' born [[June 7]], [[1981]]) was a professional [[tennis]] player. She was one of the best known tennis players, even among those who do not follow the game. Anna was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] to Alla and Sergei Kournikov; her family later emigrated to the [[United States]], and she currently resides in [[Miami, Florida]]. Anna's major-league tennis career has been curtailed for the past several years by serious back &amp; spinal problems, and this might be the end of it. Anna has had some success at the singles game, but her specialty has been doubles, where she has become the world's #1 doubles player at times, and she has won Grand Slam titles in [[Australia]] in 1999 and 2002, with [[Martina Hingis]] as her partner. With Anna's being taller than the average tennis player, and being strong at the net and at the serve, she fits well into doubles. [Other comparable players have been [[Pam Shriver]] and [[Peter Fleming]], with numerous doubles championships to their credit, playing with shorter partners, such as [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[John McEnroe]]. With their skill and good looks, Anna and Martina jestingly called themselves &quot;The Spice Girls of Tennis&quot;.

==Tennis career==
[[Image:Anna Kournikova plait.jpg|thumb|left|Playing tennis.]]
Kournikova dazzled the world at age 13 and 14 in international junior tennis, winning several tournaments including the [[1995]] [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]]. Kournikova was 14 years old when she ended 1995 as Junior European Champion Under 18 and ITF Junior World Champion Under 18.

Kournikova debuted in professional tennis at age 14 in the [[Fed Cup]] for Russia, the youngest player ever to participate and win. At age 15, she reached the fourth round of the 1996 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], only to be stopped by then-top ranked player [[Steffi Graf]].

Kournikova was a member of the Russian delegation to the [[1996 Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1997, as a 16-year old, she reached the semi-finals of [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], where she lost to the eventual champion, [[Martina Hingis]] by a score of 6-3, 6-2. 1998 was her breakthrough year, when she broke into the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]'s top 20 rankings for the first time and scored impressive victories over [[Martina Hingis]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], and [[Steffi Graf]]. Kournikova's two [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] doubles titles came in [[1999]] and [[2002]], both at the [[Australian Open]] in the Women's Doubles event with partner [[Martina Hingis]], with whom she played frequently starting in 1999.

Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the [[U.S. Open]] and at Wimbledon, and reaching #1 ranking in doubles in the [[Women's Tennis Association]] tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200-71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between #10 and #15 (her career high singles ranking was #8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one. One contributing factor might have been her habit of entering high-profile events with strong fields of elite players. As a player, Kournikova was noted for her excellent footspeed and aggressive baseline play; however, her flat, high-risk groundstrokes tended to produce high numbers of errors and her serve was sometimes unreliable in singles. [Anyone who wins big at doubles MUST serve well.] She had a record of 209-129 as a singles player.

Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which saw her ranking gradually erode. Kournikova has not played on the WTA tour since 2003, but still plays exhibition matches for charitable causes. In late 2004, she participated in three events organized by [[Elton John]] and by fellow tennis stars and good friends [[Serena Williams]] and [[Andy Roddick]]. In January [[2005]], she played in a doubles charity event for the [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] with [[John McEnroe]], Roddick, and [[Chris Evert]]. 

Anna was also a member of the Newport Beachbreakers in the World Team Tennis (WTT) competition in July and November 2005, playing doubles only. In November 2005 she teamed up with [[Martina Hingis]] playing against [[Lisa Raymond]] and [[Samantha Stosur]] in the WTT finals for charity. In a feature for ''[[Elle]]'' magazine's July 2005 issue, Kournikova stated that if she were 100% fit, she would like to come back and compete again.

==Media publicity==
[[Image:anna12.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kournikova on the July, 2000 cover of [[Sports Illustrated]]]]Much of Anna's fame -- more, many have argued, than she ever gained in her tennis career -- has come from the publicity surrounding her personal life as well as numerous modeling shoots. During her debut at the 1996 U.S. Open 1996 at the age of 15, Kournikova's physical beauty was noticed by the world and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines all over the planet. Anna has fine facial features and an attractive body, topped off by long blonde hair, sometimes braided into a meter-long queue (pony tail).

Many media outlets have reported that Kournikova was very briefly married to NHL hockey star [[Sergei Fedorov]] during the summer of 2001, though her agent and family deny this claim. A number of her relationships with other [[celebrity|celebrities]], including involvements with [[pop music|pop star]] [[Enrique Iglesias]] (whose video, ''Escape'', she appeared in) and hockey player [[Pavel Bure]], have also featured prominently in the [[tabloid|tabloid press]].
 
In 2000 Anna became the new face for [[Berlei]]'s shock absorber sports bras range, and appeared in the highly successful &quot;only the ball should bounce&quot; bill board campaign. Photographs of her scantily-clad form have appeared in various [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]]s, including more than one much-publicized [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]s (2004-05), where she posed in bikinis and swimsuits, and in other popular men's publications such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''. So far, she has not posed topless or nude for any publications.
 
Kournikova was named one of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'''s 50 Most Beautiful People in [[1998]], [[2000]], [[2002]], and [[2003]]. She has also been voted &quot;hottest female athlete&quot; and &quot;hottest couple&quot; (with Iglesias) on [[ESPN.com]] and 2003's &quot;sexiest woman in the world&quot; by worldwide [[FHM]] readers for. By contrast, [[ESPN]] -- citing the degree of hype as compared to actual accomplishments as a singles player -- ranked Anna 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in its &quot;25 Biggest Sports Flops of the Past 25 Years&quot;.

Kournikova had a small role (as a motel manager) in the 2000 film ''[[Me, Myself and Irene]]'', starring [[Jim Carrey]].

'''Atheism''', in its broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|gods]]. This definition includes as atheists both those who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not. Narrower definitions, however, often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists, labeling the others as [[nontheism|nontheists]] or [[Agnosticism|agnostics]].

Although atheists often share common concerns regarding [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence and the [[scientific method]] of investigation and a large number are [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]], there is no single [[ideology]] that all atheists share. Additionally, there are certain individuals whose [[Religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs some might describe as atheistic, though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists. 

Atheism should not be confused with the related, but not equivalent, position of [[antitheism]], as many atheists do not directly oppose theism.

==Etymology==
In early [[Ancient Greek]], the adjective ''atheos'' (from [[privative a|privative ''a-'']] + ''theos'' &quot;gods&quot;) meant &quot;without gods&quot; or &quot;lack of belief in gods&quot;. The word acquired an additional meaning in the [[5th century BCE]], expressing a total lack of relations with the gods; that is, &quot;denying the gods, godless, ungodly&quot;, with more active connotations than ''asebēs'', &quot;impious&quot;. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate ''atheos'' as &quot;atheistic&quot;. As an abstract noun, there was also ''atheotēs'': &quot;atheism&quot;. [[Cicero]] transliterated ''atheos'' into [[Latin]]. The discussion of ''atheoi'' was pronounced in the debate between early Christians and pagans, who each attributed atheism to the other. 

A.B. Drachmann (1922) notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atheism and atheist are words formed from Greek roots and with Greek derivative endings. Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage. In Greek they said ''atheos'' and ''atheotes''; to these the English words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely. In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''atheos'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed. (p.5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[English language|English]], the term ''atheism'' is the result of the adoption of the [[French language|French]] ''athéisme'' in about 1587. The term ''atheist'' in the sense of &quot;one who denies or disbelieves&quot; actually predates atheism, being first attested in about 1571 (the phrase ''Italian atheoi'' is recorded as early as 1568). ''Atheist'' in the sense of practical godlessness was first attested in 1577. The French word is derived from ''athée'', &quot;godless, atheist&quot;, which in turn is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''atheos''. The words ''deist'' and ''theist'' entered English after ''atheism'', being first attested in 1621 and 1662, respectively, with ''[[theism]]'' and ''[[deism]]'' following in 1678 and 1682, respectively. ''Deism'' and ''theism'' exchanged meanings around 1700 due to the influence of ''atheism''. ''Deism'' was originally used with a meaning comparable to today's ''theism'', and vice-versa.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] also records an earlier irregular formation, ''atheonism'', dated from about 1534. The later and now obsolete words ''athean'' and ''atheal'' are dated to 1611 and 1612, respectively.

==Types and typologies of atheism==
Many people have disagreed on how best to characterize atheism, and much of the literature on the subject is erroneous or confusing. There are many discrepancies in the use of terminology between proponents and opponents of atheism, and even divergent definitions among those who share near-identical beliefs.

Among proponents of atheism and neutral parties, there are two major traditions in defining atheism and its subdivisions. The first tradition understands atheism very broadly, as including both those who believe gods don't exist (''[[strong atheism]]'') and those who are simply not theists (''[[weak atheism]]''). [[George H. Smith]], [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], and (formerly) [[Antony Flew]] fall into this tradition, though they do not use the same terminology. (Flew has recently adopted a form of [[deism]].)

The second tradition understands atheism more narrowly, as the conscious rejection of theism, and does not consider absence of theistic belief or suspension of judgment concerning theism to be forms of atheism. [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] and [[Kai Nielsen]] are prominent members of this camp. Using this definition of atheism, &quot;[[Atheism#Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit atheism]]&quot;, lack of theism without the conscious rejection of it, may not be regarded as atheistic at all, and the umbrella term ''[[nontheism]]'' may be used in its place.

A third tradition, more common among laypeople, understands atheism even more narrowly than that. Here, atheism is defined in the strongest possible terms, as the belief that there is no god.  Such usage is not exclusive to laypeople, however--atheist philosopher Theodore Drange uses the narrow definition [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/defending.html].

===Atheism as lack of theism===
Among modern atheists, the view that atheism means &quot;without [or, polemically, &quot;free of&quot;] theistic beliefs&quot; has a great deal of currency. This very broad definition is justified by reference to etymology as well as consistent usage of the word by atheists. 

However, this definition of atheism has not gone unchallenged. Although, over the last few hundred years, atheism has evolved and broadened beyond the narrow meaning of &quot;wickedness&quot;, impiety, heresy and religious denial, as well as [[pantheism]] and similar beliefs, it is less commonly understood to include everything not explicitly theistic. Whether a writer's definition of atheism as an &quot;absence&quot; or &quot;lack&quot; of theistic belief is in fact intended to mean &quot;not theistic&quot; in the widest possible sense, or just refers to particular forms of the rejection of theism (see below), is often ambiguous.

However, while this definition of atheism is frequently disputed, it is not a recent invention; this use has a history spanning over 230 years. Two atheist writers who are clear in defining atheism so broadly that uninformed children are counted as atheists are d'Holbach (1772) (&quot;All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God&quot; [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/gsens10.txt]) and George H. Smith (1979).

According to Smith,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child without the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist. (p.14) [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One atheist writer who explicitly disagrees with such a broad definition is Ernest Nagel (1965):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief... Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist - for he is not denying any theistic claims. (p.460-461)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Nagel, atheism is the ''rejection'' of theism, not just the absence of theistic belief. However, this definition leaves open the question of what term can be used to describe those who lack theistic belief, but do not necessarily reject theism.

The obsolete word ''atheous'', first recorded in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym of atheism or impiety, is sometimes used to mean &quot;not dealing with the existence of a god&quot; in a purely privative sense, as distinguished from the negative ''atheistic''. This 1880 coinage captures some of what is intended by the broad definition of atheism, though it is hard to sustain the claim that the philosophical rejection of theism can be characterized in such terms.

====Implicit and explicit atheism====
[[Image:Atheismimplicitexplicit2.PNG|thumb|230px|A chart showing the relationship between the weak/strong (positive/negative) and implicit/explicit dichotomies. Strong atheism is always explicit, and implicit atheism is always weak.]]
The terms ''implicit atheism'' and ''explicit atheism'' were coined by George H. Smith (1979, p.13-18). 

Implicit atheism is defined by Smith as &quot;the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it.&quot; Explicit atheism is defined as &quot;the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it&quot;, which, according to Smith, is sometimes called ''antitheism'' (see below). 

For Smith, explicit atheism is subdivided further according to whether or not the rejection is on rational grounds. The term ''critical atheism'' is used to label the view that belief in god is irrational, and is itself subdivided into a) the view usually expressed by the statement &quot;I do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being&quot;; b) the view usually expressed by the statement, &quot;god does not exist&quot; or &quot;the existence of god is impossible&quot;; and c) the view which &quot;refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god&quot; because &quot;the concept of a god is unintelligible&quot; (p.17).

Although Nagel rejects Smith's definition of atheism as merely &quot;lack of theism&quot;, acknowledging only explicit &quot;atheism&quot; as true atheism, his tripartite classification of ''rejectionist atheism'' (commonly found in the philosophical literature) is identical to Smith's ''critical atheism'' typology.

The difference between Nagel on the one hand and d'Holbach and Smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism (see Smith (1990, Chapter 3, p.51-60 [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm]), for example, but also alluded to by others).

Everitt (2004) makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to distinguish between a ''biographical'' or ''sociological'' enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in God, and an ''epistemological'' enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief... We are interested in the question of what ''good reasons'' there are for or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them. (p.10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, in philosophy (Flew and Martin notwithstanding), atheism is commonly defined along the lines of &quot;rejection of theistic belief&quot;. This is often misunderstood to mean only the view that there is no God, but it is conventional to distinguish between two or three main sub-types of atheism in this sense (writers differ in their characterization of this distinction, and in the labels they use for these positions).

The terms ''weak atheism'' and ''strong atheism'' (or ''negative atheism'' and ''positive atheism'') are often used as synonyms of Smith's less-well-known ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' categories. However, the original and technical meanings of implicit and explicit atheism are quite different and distinct from weak and strong atheism, having to do with conscious rejection and unconscious rejection of theism rather than with positive belief and negative belief.

People who do not use the broad definition of atheism as &quot;lack of theism&quot;, but instead use the most common definition &quot;disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods&quot; [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=atheism] would not recognize mere absence of belief in deities (implicit atheism) as a type of atheism at all, and would tend to use other terms, such as &quot;skeptic&quot; or &quot;agnostic&quot; or &quot;non-atheistic nontheism&quot;, for this position.

===Atheism as immorality===
The first attempts to define or develop a typology of atheism were in religious apologetics. These attempts were expressed in terminologies and in contexts which reflected the religious assumptions and prejudices of the writers. A diversity of atheist opinion has been recognized at least since [[Plato]], and common distinctions have been established between ''practical atheism'' and ''speculative'' or ''contemplative atheism''.

====Practical atheism====
Practical atheism was said to be caused by moral failure, hypocrisy, willful ignorance and infidelity. Practical atheists ''behaved'' as though God, morals, ethics and social responsibility did not exist. Maritain's typology of atheism (1953, Chapter 8) proved influential in Catholic circles; it was followed in the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (see Reid (1967)). He identified, in addition to practical atheism, ''pseudo-atheism'' and ''absolute atheism'' (and subdivided theoretical atheism in a way that anticipated Flew). For an atheist critique of Maritain, see Smith (1979, Chapter 1, Section 5) [http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm].

According to the French Catholic philosopher Étienne Borne (1961, p.10), &quot;Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law.&quot; 

According to [[Karen Armstrong]] (1999):

&lt;blockquote&gt; During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for polemic... In his tract ''Atheism Closed and Open Anatomized'' (1634), John Wingfield claimed: &quot;the hypocrite is an Atheist; the loose wicked man is an open Atheist; the secure, bold and proud transgressor is an Atheist: he that will not be taught or reformed is an Atheist&quot;. For the [[Wales|Welsh]] poet [[William Vaughan]] (1577 [sic]-1641), who helped in the colonisation of [[Newfoundland]], those who raised rents or enclosed commons were obvious atheists. The English dramatist [[Thomas Nashe]] (1567-1601) proclaimed that the ambitious, the greedy, the gluttons, the vainglorious and prostitutes were all atheists. The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist. (p.331-332) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the existence of serious speculative atheism was often denied. That anyone might ''reason'' their way to atheism was thought to be impossible. Thus, speculative atheism was collapsed into a form of practical atheism, or conceptualized as hatred of God, or a fight against God. This is why Borne finds it necessary to say, &quot;to put forward the idea, as some apologists rashly do, that there are no atheists except in name but only 'practical atheists' who through pride or idleness disregard the divine law, would be, at least at the beginning of the argument, a rhetorical convenience or an emotional prejudice evading the real question.&quot; (p.18)

Martin (1990, p.465-466) suggests that practical atheism would be better described as ''alienated theism''.

====Other pejorative definitions of atheism====
When denial of the existence of &quot;speculative&quot; atheism became unsustainable, atheism was nevertheless often repressed and criticized by narrowing definitions, applying charges of dogmatism, and otherwise misrepresenting atheist positions. One of the reasons for the popularity of euphemistic alternative terms like [[secularism|secularist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[agnosticism|agnostic]], or [[bright (noun)|bright]] is that ''atheism'' still has pejorative connotations arising from attempts at suppression and from its association with practical atheism (''godless'' is still used as an abusive epithet).

Mynga Futrell and Paul Geisert, the originators of the term ''Bright'', made this explicit in an essay published in 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our personal frustration regarding labels reached culmination last fall when we were invited to join a march on Washington as &quot;Godless Americans.&quot; The causes of the march were worthy, and the march itself well planned and conducted. However, to unite for common interests under a disparaging term like godless (it also means &quot;wicked&quot;) seemed ludicrous! Why accept and utilize the very derogatory language that so clearly hampers our own capacity to play a positive and contributing role in our communities and in the nation and world? [http://www.the-brights.net/vision/essays/futrell_geisert_nix.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gaskin (1989) abandoned the term ''atheism'' in favour of ''unbelief'', citing &quot;the pejorative associations of the term, its vagueness, and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist...&quot; (p.4)

Despite these considerations, for others ''atheist'' has always been the preferred name. [[Charles Bradlaugh]] once said (in debate with [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[10 March]] [[1870]], cited in Bradlaugh Bonner (1908)):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I maintain that the opprobrium cast upon the word Atheism is a lie. I believe Atheists as a body to be men deserving respect... I do not care what kind of character religious men may put round the word Atheist, I would fight until men respect it. (p.334) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For more on repressive definitions of atheism, see Berman (1982), (1983), (1990).

===Weak and strong atheism===
:''Main articles: [[Weak atheism]], [[Strong atheism]]'' 

''[[Weak atheism]]'', sometimes called ''soft atheism'', ''negative atheism'' or ''neutral atheism'', is the absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|deities]] without the positive assertion that deities do not exist. ''[[Strong atheism]]'', also known as ''hard atheism'' or ''positive atheism'', is the belief that no deities exist.

While the terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, the concepts they represent have been in use for some time. In earlier philosophical publications, the terms ''negative atheism'' and ''positive atheism'' were more common; these terms were used by [[Antony Flew]] in 1972, although [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953, Chapter 8, p.104) used the phrases in a similar, but strictly Catholic apologist, context as early as 1949 [http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm].

Although explicit atheists ([[nontheism|nontheists]] who consciously reject theism), may subscribe to either ''weak'' or ''strong'' atheism, weak atheism also includes implicit atheists - that is, nontheists who have not consciously rejected theism, but lack theistic belief, arguably including infants.

Theists claim that a single deity or group of deities exists. Weak atheists do not assert the contrary; instead, they only refrain from assenting to theistic claims. Some weak atheists are without any opinion regarding the existence of deities, either because of a lack of thought on the matter, a lack of interest in the matter (see [[apatheism]]), or a belief that the arguments and evidence provided by both theists and strong atheists are equally unpersuasive. Others (explicit weak atheists) may doubt or dispute claims for the existence of deities, while not actively asserting that deities do not exist, following [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] famous dictum, &quot;Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must remain silent.&quot;

Some weak atheists feel that theism and strong atheism are equally untenable, on the grounds that faith is required both to assert and to deny the existence of deities, and as such both theism and strong atheism have the burden of proof placed on them to prove that a god does or doesn't exist. Some also base their belief on the notion that it is impossible to prove a negative.

While a weak atheist might consider the nonexistence of deities likely on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to justify belief in a deity's existence, a strong atheist has the additional view that positive statements of nonexistence are merited when evidence or arguments indicate that a deity's nonexistence is certain or probable.

Strong atheism may be based on arguments that the concept of a deity is self-contradictory and therefore impossible (positive [[ignosticism]]), or that one or more of the properties attributed to a deity are incompatible with what we observe in the world.  Examples of this may be found in quantum physics, where the existence of mutually exclusive data negates the possibility of omniscience, usually a core attribute of monotheistic conceptions of deity.

''[[Agnosticism]]'' is distinct from strong atheism, though many weak atheists may be agnostics, and those who are strong atheists with regard to a particular deity might be weak atheists or agnostics with regard to other deities.

===Ignosticism===
:''Main article: [[Ignosticism]]''

Ignosticism is the view that the question of whether or not deities exist is inherently meaningless. It is a popular view among many [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] such as [[Rudolph Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], who hold that talk of gods is literally [[nonsense]]. According to ignostics, &quot;Does a god exist?&quot; has the same logical status as &quot;What color is Saturday?&quot;; they are both nonsensical, and thus have no meaningful answers.

Ignostics commonly hold that statements about religious or other transcendent experiences cannot have any truth value, often because theological statements lack [[falsifiability]], because of an [[epistemology|epistemological]] view that renders the [[ontological argument]] nonsensical, or because the terminology being used has not been properly or consistently defined &amp;mdash; the latter view is known as [[theological noncognitivism]].

The use of the word &quot;god&quot; is thus solely a matter of [[semantics]] to ignostics, dealing with word use and technicalities rather than with existence and reality.

In ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Ayer stated that theism, atheism and agnosticism were equally meaningless, insofar as they treat the question of the existence of God as a real question. However, there are varieties of atheism and agnosticism which do not necessarily agree that the question is meaningful, especially using the &quot;lack of theism&quot; definition of atheism. Despite Ayer's criticism of atheism (perhaps using the definition typically associated with [[strong atheism]]), Ignosticism is usually counted as a form of atheism; Ayer (1966) was clear on his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it. (p226) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ignostic position is mentioned (though the term ''ignostic'' is not used) as one of the three forms of &quot;critical atheism&quot; (in Smith) or &quot;rejectionist atheism&quot; (in Nagel). Active disbelief in god or supernatural beings is one other type of critical/rejectionist atheism. Finally, the third type is the positive claim that deities do not exist. Since critical/rejectionist atheism is a type of explicit atheism, if follows that ignosticism is a type of explicit atheism. There is some debate over whether it should be classified as [[weak atheism]] or [[strong atheism]].

Ignosticism is distinct from apatheism in that while ignostics hold ''questions'' and ''discussions'' of whether deities exist to be meaningless, apatheists hold that even a hypothetical ''answer'' to such questions would be completely irrelevant to human existence.

===Gnostic and agnostic atheism===
:''Main article: [[Agnostic atheism]]''

Agnostic atheism is a fusion of atheism or [[nontheism]] with [[agnosticism]], the [[epistemology|epistemological]] position that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown ([[weak agnosticism]]) or unknowable ([[strong agnosticism]]). Agnostic atheism is typically contrasted with [[agnostic theism]], the belief that deities exist even though it is impossible to know that deities exist, and with gnostic atheism, the belief that there is enough information to determine that deities do not exist.

''Agnostic atheism'''s definition varies, just as the definitions of agnosticism and atheism do. It may be a combination of lack of theism with [[strong agnosticism]], the view that it is impossible to know whether deities exist to any reliable degree. It may also be a combination of lack of theism with [[weak agnosticism]], the view that there is not currently enough information to decide whether or not a deity exists, but that there may be enough in the future.

''Gnostic atheism'' is a more rarely used term, because often anyone who is not labeled as agnostic is assumed to be gnostic by default. Gnostic atheism also has varying meanings. When nontheism is combined with strong gnosticism, it denotes the belief that it is rational to be absolutely certain that deities do not, and perhaps cannot, exist. When it is with weak gnosticism, it denotes the belief that there is enough information to be reasonably sure that deities do not exist, but not absolutely certain. The term should not be confused with [[Gnosticism]]. 

''Gnostic atheism'' is also sometimes used as a synonym of [[strong atheism]], and thus ''agnostic atheism'' is occasionally a synonym for [[weak atheism]]. This is similar to the more common confusion of the terms ''implicit atheism'' and ''explicit atheism'' with strong and weak atheism.

[[Apatheism]] often overlaps with agnostic atheism, such as with [[apathetic agnosticism]], a fusion of apatheism with strong agnostic atheism.

===Atheism in philosophical naturalism===
Many, if not most, atheists have preferred to say that atheism is a lack of a belief, rather than a belief in its own right (see, for example, Krueger (1998, p.22-24); Smith (1979, p.15-16)). This keeps the burden of proof on the theist (see Flew (1984b)), as the only one making any positive assertions. &quot;Belief&quot; also has other connotations that many atheists may wish to avoid. 

Nevertheless, some atheist writers identify atheism with the [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic world view]], and defend it on that basis. The case for naturalism is used as a positive argument for atheism. See, for example, Thrower (1971), Harbour (2001), [[Kai Nielsen|Nielsen]] (2001) and [[Julian Baggini|Baggini]] (2003). See also Everitt's discussion of an anti-atheist argument against naturalism (2004, Chapter 9, p.178-190).

According to Thrower,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much atheism... can be understood only in the light of the current theism which it was concerned to reject. Such atheism is relative. There is, however, a way of looking at and interpreting events in the world, whose origins... can be seen as early as the beginnings of speculative thought itself, and which I shall call naturalistic, that is atheistic per se, in the sense that it is incompatible with any and every form of supernaturalism... naturalistic or absolute atheism is both fundamentally more important, and more interesting, representing as it does one polarity in the development of the human spirit. (p.3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Julian Baggini]] argues that, &quot;atheism can be understood not simply as a denial of religion, but as a self-contained belief system, if it is seen as a commitment to the view that there is only one world and this is the world of nature&quot; (p.74). For Baggini, therefore,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the evidence for atheism is to be found in the fact that there is a plethora of evidence for the truth of naturalism and an absence of evidence for anything else. 'Anything else' of course includes God, but it also includes goblins, hobbits, and truly everlasting gobstoppers. There is nothing special about God in this sense. God is just one of the things that atheists don't believe in, it just happens to be the thing that, for historical reasons, gave them their name. (p.17) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baggini's position is that &quot;an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls, life after death, ghosts, or supernatural powers. Although strictly speaking an atheist could believe in any of these things and still remain an atheist... the arguments and ideas that sustain atheism tend naturally to rule out other beliefs in the supernatural or transcendental&quot; (p.3-4).

[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] (1990, p.470) notes that the view that &quot;naturalism is compatible with nonatheism is true only if 'god' is understood in a most peculiar and misleading way&quot;, but he also points out that &quot;atheism does not entail naturalism&quot;.

===Antitheism===
:''Main article: [[Antitheism]]''

''Antitheism'' (sometimes hyphenated) typically refers to a direct opposition to [[theism]]. In this use, it is a form of critical [[strong atheism]]. Antitheism may sometimes overlap with [[ignosticism]], the view that theism is inherently meaningless, and may directly contradict [[apatheism]], the view that theism is irrelevant rather than dangerous.

However, ''antitheism'' is also sometimes used, particularly in religious contexts, to refer to opposition to [[God]] or [[divine]] things, rather than to the belief in God. Using the latter definition, it may be possible &amp;mdash; or perhaps even necessary &amp;mdash; to be an antitheist without being an atheist or nontheist.

Antitheists may believe that theism is actually harmful, or may simply be atheists who have little tolerance for views they perceive as [[irrationality|irrational]]. Strong atheists who are not antitheists may believe positively that deities do not exist, but not believe that theism is directly harmful or necessitates opposition.

==History==
{{main|History of atheism}}

Although the actual term ''atheism'' originated in 16th Century [[France]], ideas that would be recognized as atheistic today existed even before [[Classical Antiquity]]. [[Epicurus]] proposed theories that can be classified as atheistic, such as a lack of belief in an afterlife, though he remained ambiguous concerning the actual existence of deities. Before him, [[Socrates]] was [[Trial of Socrates|sentenced to death]] partly on the grounds that he was an atheist, although he did express belief in several forms of divinity, as recorded in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''. This criminal connotation attached to atheistic ideas ([[heresy]]) would remain, at varying levels of severity, until [[the Renaissance]], when criticism of the Church became more prevalent and tolerated.

Atheism disappeared from the philosophy of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] traditions as [[Christianity]] gained influence. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of atheism re-emerged as an accusation against those who questioned the religious [[status quo]], but by the late 18th century it had become the philosophical position of a growing minority. By the 20th century, along with the spread of [[rationalism]] and [[secular humanism]], atheism had become common, particularly among [[scientist|scientists]] (see [[#International survey of contemporary atheism|international survey of contemporary atheism]]). In the 20th Century, atheism also became a staple of the various [[Communism|Communist]] regimes, helping return some of the negative connotations of atheism, especially in the [[United States]], where the term became synonymous with being unpatriotic during the [[Cold War]].

==Distribution of atheists==
Though atheists are a minority group in most countries, they are relatively common in [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], in former and present [[communist state]]s, and, to a lesser extent, in the [[United States]].

Atheism is particularly prevalent among [[scientist]]s, a tendency already quite marked at the beginning of the 20th century, developing into a dominant one during the course of the century. In 1914, [[James H. Leuba]] found that 58% of 1,000 randomly selected U.S. [[natural science|natural scientists]] expressed &quot;disbelief or doubt in the existence of God&quot;. The same study, repeated in 1996, gave a similar percentage of 60.7%; this number is 93% among the members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. Expressions of positive disbelief rose from 52% to 72%. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html] (See also [[The relationship between religion and science]]). 

===Atheism in the United Kingdom===
A poll in 2004 by the [[BBC]] put the number of people who do not believe in God to be 40% [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm], while a [[YouGov]] poll in the same year put the percentage of non-believers at 35% with 21% uncertain
[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/graphics/2004/12/27/nfaith27big.gif]. In the YouGov poll men were less likely to 
believe in god than women and younger people were less likely to believe in god than older people.

In early 2004, it was announced that atheism would be taught during religious education classes in the [[United Kingdom]]. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,6903,1148578,00.html] A spokesman for the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] stated: &quot;There are many children in England who have no religious affiliation and their beliefs and ideas, whatever they are, should be taken very seriously.&quot; There is also considerable debate in the U.K. on the status of [[faith-based schools]], which use religious as well as academic selection criteria. The decision was based on a Parliament decision ruling that, while questionable in moral standing, Atheism is a legitimate religion (although atheism is not a religion in any sense, this indicates that atheism should be treated the same as theism). Atheism is championed by many scientists and [[philosophers]] in the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Richard Dawkins]].

===Atheism in the United States===
A [[Gallup poll]] in 2005 showed 5% of the US population feel that God does not exist [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001659292]. A poll in 2004 by the [[BBC]] showed the number of people who don't believe in God to be larger, at 10% [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm]. However, unbelief in God does not imply self-identification as an atheist.

Atheists are ostensibly legally protected from discrimination in the United States. They have been among the strongest advocates of the legal [[separation of church and state]]. American courts have regularly, if controversially, interpreted the constitutional requirement for separation of church and state as protecting the freedoms of non-believers, as well as prohibiting the establishment of any state religion. Atheists often sum up the legal situation with the phrase: &quot;Freedom of religion also means freedom ''from'' religion.&quot; [http://www.au.org/]

In [[Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet]][http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=U10355], Justice Souter wrote in the opinion for the Court that: &quot;government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to [[irreligion]].&quot; [http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-517.ZS.html] [[Everson v. Board of Education]] established that &quot;''neither a state nor the Federal Government can''...'' pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another''&quot;. This applies the Establishment Clause to the states as well as the federal government. [http://atheism.about.com/library/decisions/religion/bl_l_BoEEverson.htm] However, several state constitutions make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgement of the existence of a deity, apparently making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to atheists. These state constitutional clauses have not been tested. Additionally, some state constitutions (namely, [[Arkansas Constitution|Arkansas]] and [[South Carolina Constitution|South Carolina]]) disallow atheists to hold public office, although most agree that, if challenged, these requirements would be ruled unconstitutional under [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]] which bans such qualifications. Civil rights cases are typically brought in federal courts; so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.
 	
In the [[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow|Newdow case]], after a father challenged the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the United States [[Pledge of Allegiance]], the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the phrase unconstitutional. Although the decision was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal, there was the prospect that the pledge would cease to be legally usable without modification in schools in the western United States, over which the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction. This resulted in political furor, and both houses of Congress passed resolutions condemning the decision, nearly unanimously. A very large group consisting of almost the entire Senate and House was televised standing on the steps of Congress, hands over hearts, swearing the pledge and shouting out &quot;under God&quot;. The Supreme Court subsequently reversed the decision, ruling that [[Michael Newdow]] did not have standing to bring his case, thus disposing of the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the pledge.

==Atheism studies and statistics==
As some governments have strongly promoted atheism, whilst others have strongly condemned it, atheism may be either over-reported or under-reported for different countries. There is a great deal of room for debate as to the accuracy of any method of estimation, as the opportunity for misreporting (intentionally or not) a belief system without an organized structure is high. Also, many surveys on religious identification ask people to identify themselves as &quot;agnostics&quot; or &quot;atheists&quot;, which is potentially confusing, since these terms are interpreted differently by many different people, with some identifying themselves as being both atheist and agnostic. Additionally, many of these surveys only gauge the number of [[irreligion|irreligious]] people, not the number of actual atheists, or group the two together.

The following surveys are in chronological order, but as they are different studies with different methodologies it would be inaccurate to infer trends on the prevalence of atheism from them:

*A 1995 survey [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html] attributed to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] indicates that the non-religious are about 14.7% of the world's population, and atheists around 3.8%.

*The 2001 [http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm ARIS report] found that while 29.5 million U.S. Americans (14.1%) describe themselves as &quot;without religion&quot;, only 902,000 (0.4%) positively claim to be atheist, with another 991,000 (0.5%) professing agnosticism.

*In the 2001 Australian Census [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/9658217eba753c2cca256cae00053fa3?OpenDocument] 15.5% of respondents ticked &quot;no religion&quot;, and a further 11.7% either did not state their religion or were deemed to have described it inadequately (there was a popular and successful campaign at the time to have people describe themselves as [[Jedi census phenomenon|Jedi]]).

*The 2001 [[New Zealand]] census [http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/Articles/census-snpsht-cult-diversity-Mar02.htm] showed that 40% of the respondents claimed &quot;no religion&quot;.

*In 2001, the [http://www.czso.cz/csu/edicniplan.nsf/o/4110-03--skladba_obyvatelstva_podle_nabozenskeho_vyznani,_pohlavi_a_podle_veku Czech Statistical Office] provided census information on the ten million people in the [[Czech Republic]]. 59% had no religion, 32.2% were religious, and 8.8% did not answer. This suggests that the Czech Republic is probably the most atheistic country in the world.

*In 2002 survey in [[Demographics of Russia|Russia]], 32% self-described as atheist. Of the 58% self-describing as Russian Orthodox Christian, 42% said they had never been in a church.

*A 2002 survey by Adherents.com [http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html] estimates the proportion of the world's people who are &quot;secular, non-religious, agnostics and atheists&quot; as about 14%.

*In a 2003 poll in [[France]], 54% of those polled identified themselves as &quot;faithful&quot;, 33% as atheist, 14% as agnostic, and 26% as &quot;[[apatheism|indifferent]]&quot;. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35454.htm]

*A 2004 survey by the BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/3518375.stm] in 10 countries showed the proportion of the population &quot;who don't believe in God&quot; varying between 0% and 44%, with an average close to 17% in the countries surveyed. About 8% of the respondents stated specifically that they consider themselves to be atheists.

*A 2004 survey by the CIA in the World Factbook [http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/xx.html#People] estimates about 12.5% of the world's population are non-religious, and about 2.4% are atheists. 

*A 2004 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] [http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=757] showed that in the United States, 12% of people under 30 and 6% of people over 30 could be characterized as non-religious.

*A 2005 poll by AP/Ipsos [http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2694] surveyed ten countries. Of the developed nations, people in the [[United States]] had most certainty about the existence of god or a higher power (2% atheist, 4% agnostic), while [[France]] had the most skeptics (19% atheist, 16% agnostic). On the religion question, [[South Korea]] had the greatest percentage without a religion (41%) while [[Italy]] had the smallest (5%).

* A 2006 survey in the Norwegian newspaper [[Aftenposten]] (on [[February 17]]), saw 1006 inhabitants of [[Norway]] answering the question &quot;What do you believe in?&quot;. 29% answered &quot;I believe in a god or deity&quot;, 23% answered &quot;I believe in a higher power without being certain of what&quot;, 26% answered &quot;I don't believe in god or higher powers&quot;, and 22% answered &quot;I am in doubt&quot;. Depending on the definition of atheism, Norway thus has between 49% and 71% atheists. Still, some 85% of the population are members of the Norwegian state's official [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] church. Parts of this deviance is due to the fact that all non-affilated Norwegians were signed into this church a few years before (without being asked), and that signing out, if they are even aware of being signed in, is a time-consuming, bureaucratic affair yielding no immediate gains.

===Statistical problems===
Statistics on atheism are often difficult to accurately represent for a variety of reasons.

====Atheism is nonexclusive====
Atheism is a position compatible with other forms of identity. Some atheists also consider themselves [[Agnosticism|Agnostic]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Jainism|Jains]] or hold other related philosophical beliefs. Therefore, given limited poll options, some may use other terms to describe their identity.

====Misrepresentation====
Some politically motivated organizations that report or gather population statistics may, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresent atheists. Survey designs may bias results due to the nature of elements such as the wording of questions and the available response options. Also, many atheists, particularly former Catholics, are still counted as [[Christianity|Christian]]s in church rosters, although surveys generally ask samples of the population and do not look in church rosters. Some Christians believe that ''&quot;once a person is &lt;nowiki&gt;[truly]&lt;/nowiki&gt; saved, that person is always saved&quot;'', a doctrine known as [[Perseverance of the saints|eternal security]]. [http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternalsecurity1.htm].

====Attitudes toward religion====
Statistics are generally collected on the assumption that religion is a categorical variable. As terms such as ''weak atheism'' and ''strong atheism'' suggest, however, people vary in terms of the strength of their convictions. Instruments have been designed to measure attitudes toward religion, including one that was used by [[L. L. Thurstone]]. This may be a particularly important consideration among people who have neutral attitudes, as it is more likely prevailing social norms will influence the responses of such people on survey questions which effectively force respondents to categorize themselves either as belonging to a particular relgion or belonging to no religion.

====Misunderstanding and external pressure====
A negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism. Misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently.

====Discrimination====
Legal and social discrimination against atheists in some places may lead some to deny or conceal their atheism due to fears of persecution.

For example, in the 20th century, atheists, socialists and communists were persecuted alongside Jews by the Nazis, who lumped all of these terms into one complex issue or theme ('the Jewish-Bolshevik world conspiracy', as addressed in [[Joseph Goebbels]]' 1935 speech &quot;Communism with the Mask Off&quot;, in which Christian civilization -national socialism- was described as antithetical to Jewish Communism).

==Religion and atheism==
===Spiritual and religious atheism===
Although atheistic beliefs are often accompanied by a total lack of [[supernatural]] beliefs, this is not an aspect, or even a necessary consequence, of atheism. Indeed, there are many atheists who are not [[irreligion|irreligious]] or [[secularism|secular]]. These are most common in spiritualities like [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], but they also exist in sects of religions that are usually very theistic by nature, such as [[Christianity]], especially in some [[Religious Society of Friends|Liberal Quaker]] groups.
 
A number of atheistic churches have been established, such as the [http://thomasinechurch.org/ Thomasine Church], [[Naturalistic pantheism|naturalistic pantheists]], [[Brianism]], and the [[Fellowship of Reason]]. There is also an atheist presence in [[Unitarian Universalism]], an extremely [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] religion. 

====Belief in God as a non-being====
In English, believers usually refer to the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] Abrahamic god as &quot;[[God]]&quot;. In many abstract or esoteric interpretations of monotheism or [[henotheism]], God is not thought of as a supernatural being, as a deity or god. Rather, God becomes a philosophical category: the All, the One, the [[Ultimate]], the [[Absolute Infinite]], the [[Transcendent]], the Divine Ground, [[Being]] or [[Existence]] itself, etc. For example, such views are typical of [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], and religious [[monism]]. Attributing [[anthropomorphic]] characteristics to God may be regarded as idolatry, blasphemy, or symbolism by some. Some theists may not believe in, or may even deny, the existence of deities as supernatural beings, while maintaining a belief in god as so conceived.

For example, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] described God as the &quot;ground of Being&quot;, the &quot;power of Being&quot;, or as &quot;Being itself&quot;, and caused controversy by making the statement that &quot;God does not exist&quot;, resulting in him occasionally being labelled as an atheist. Nevertheless, for [[Tillich]], God is not &quot;a&quot; being that exists among other beings, but is Being itself. For him, God does not &quot;exist&quot; except as a concept or principle; God is the basis of Being, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] power by which Being triumphs over non-Being.

However, most atheists who deny the existence of deities as supernatural beings would also deny this and similar conceptions of God, or simply consider them incomprehensible. Even the broadest definitions of atheism often do not include belief in a conceptual or metaphysical God, categorizing this under theism instead.

===Judaism===
In general, formulations of [[Jewish principles of faith]] require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the [[Shema]]). In many modern movements in Judaism, rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of Judaism. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practise [[Judaism]] as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist, giving rise to the joke: &quot;Q: What do you call a Jew who doesn't believe in God? A: A Jew.&quot; It is also worth noting that [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionism]] does not require any belief in a deity, and that certain popular [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] prayer books, such as ''Gates of Prayer'', offer some services without mention of God.

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] [http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk16-kook.htm][http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/rk17-kook.htm], first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in pre-state Israel, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.

Some Jewish atheists reject Judaism, but wish to continue identifying themselves with the Jewish people and culture. See, for example, Levin (1995).  Jewish atheists who practice [[Humanistic Judaism]] embrace Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in a supernatural god, as the sources of their Jewish identity.

===Christianity===
By necessity, Christianity, as a [[theist|theistic]] and [[proselyte|proselytising]] religion views atheism as sinful.  According to [[Psalm 14:1]], &quot;The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.&quot; According to John 3:18-19, all who reject Christianity (and presumably its attendant theism) do so &quot;because their deeds are evil&quot;.

A famous but idiosyncratic atheistic belief is that of [[Thomas Altizer]]. His book ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism'' (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless &quot;a Christian confession of faith&quot; (p.102). Making clear the difference between his position and that of both [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] notion of the death of God and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense.(p.103)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, many would dispute whether this is an atheist position at all, as belief in a dead God implies that God once existed and was alive. Atheism typically entails a lack of belief that any gods ''ever'' existed, as opposed to not existing currently. For further discussion, see Lyas (1970).

Other, unrelated practitioners of Christian atheism may include [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal Christian]] atheists who follow the teaching of [[Jesus]], but who may not believe in the literal existence of god. In this case, however, many would dispute whether the atheists in question are truly [[Christianity|Christians]], though they certainly are by some of the looser definitions of the word.

It should be noted that although Christianity as a ''faith'' has to be construed as irreconcilable with atheism, this is markedly not the case regarding the church institutions which currently are nominally Christian. Indeed the great [[Positivism|positivist]] luminaries in all earnestness encompassed a Catholic Church which would retain all it's ceremonies and ecclesiastical structures, whilst transforming into a purely atheistic church, much in the same way that christianity has co-opted the organisational traditions of the native faiths it has encountered around the world, and through the ages.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], atheists are categorized as [[kafir]] (كافر), a term that is also used to describe polytheists, and that translates roughly as &quot;denier&quot; or &quot;concealer&quot;. The noun ''kafir'' carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the Islamic community. In Arabic, &quot;atheism&quot; is generally translated ''ilhad'' (إلحاد), although this also means &quot;heresy&quot;.
As the [[Sharia]] punishment for [[apostasy]] in Islam is [[death penalty|death]] and such apostasy is also widely socially disapproved of, atheists (as well as converts from Islam to other religions) in Islamic countries and communities frequently conceal their non-belief. The surveys mentioned above that indicate 100% religious belief in certain Islamic countries should be interpreted in light of this fact.

===Asian spirituality===
It is difficult to categorize the Eastern thought systems in distinct terms of theism or atheism. Therefore, it should be noted that even the thoughts that would be characterized as atheistic in the western sense, often have some theistic tendencies, and vice versa.

[[Carvaka]] (also ''Charvaka'') was a [[materialist]] and atheist school of thought in [[India]], which is now known principally from fragments cited by its [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Carvakan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world (cf [[Epicureanism]]). There is some evidence that the school persisted until at least 1578. 

[[Buddhism]] is often described as atheistic, since Buddhist authorities and canonical texts do not affirm, and sometimes deny, the following:

* The existence of a [[creation]], and therefore of a creator god
* That a god, gods, or other divine beings are the source of moral imperatives
* That human beings or other creatures are responsible to a god or gods for their actions

Buddhists might also be deemed atheistic in anti-Buddhist Hindu polemic, since Buddhists opposed the authority of the [[Vedas]] and of Vedic priests, and the power of the rituals of [[Vedic religion]].

However, all canonical Buddhist texts that mention the subject accept the ''existence'' (as distinct from the ''authority'') of a great number of deities, including the Vedic deities.  From the point of view of Western theism, certain concepts of the [[Buddha]] found in the [[Mahayana]] school of Buddhism, e.g. of [[Amitabha]] or the Adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with Western concepts of God. 

Other schools continue to consider themselves as fundamentally atheistic, in the strong sense of the term. [[Jainism]] is also sometimes classified as atheistic since Jains's believe that &quot;In the most basic sense, God is not seen as a person, place or tangible thing, but as the ideal state of an individual soul's existence&quot; [http://www.dd-b.net/~raphael/jain-list/msg01226.html].

[[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] are arguably atheistic in the sense that they do not explicitly affirm, nor are they founded upon a faith in, a higher being or beings. However, Confucian writings do have numerous references to 'Heaven,' which denotes a transcendent power, with a personal connotation. Neo-Confucian writings, such as that of [[Chu Hsi]], are vague on whether their conception of the Great Ultimate is like a personal deity or not. Also, although the Western translation of the [[Tao]] as 'god' in some editions of the [[Tao te Ching]] is highly misleading, it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the [[Tao]] by [[Lao Zi]] has theistic or atheistic undertones.

==Reasons for atheism==
Although not all atheists claim to have a rational justification for their stance, a majority of explicit atheists do assert that their stance has a rational basis, and there are some especially common reasons given by them.

===Philosophical reasons===
A majority of explicit atheists base their stance on rational or philosophical grounds, arguing that their position is based on logical analysis, and subsequent rejection, of theistic claims. These [[existence of God#Arguments_against_the_existence_of_God|arguments against the existence of deities]] consist of a number of different problems with theism. Chief among these problems is a perceived lack of evidence supporting theistic claims.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Within the framework of [[scientific]] [[rationalism]] one arrives at the belief in the nonexistence of God, not because of certain knowledge, but because of a sliding scale of methods. At one extreme, we can confidently rebut the personal Gods of creationists on firm [[empirical]] grounds: science is sufficient to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that there never was a worldwide flood and that the evolutionary sequence of the Cosmos does not follow either of the two versions of Genesis. The more we move toward a deistic and fuzzily defined God, however, the more scientific rationalism reaches into its toolbox and shifts from empirical science to [[logical]] philosophy informed by science. Ultimately, the most convincing arguments against a deistic God are [[Hume's dictum]] and [[Occam's razor]]. These are philosophical arguments, but they also constitute the bedrock of all of science, and cannot therefore be dismissed as non-scientific. The reason we put our trust in these two principles is because their application in the empirical sciences has led to such spectacular successes throughout the last three centuries.&quot; [http://psy.ucsd.edu/~eebbesen/Psych110/SciRelig.htm]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many atheists hold that as their view is merely the absence of a certain belief, the only defense that atheism needs is a good offense. If theism's arguments are refuted, nontheism, as the only alternative, becomes the default position. As such, many atheists have argued against the most famous &quot;proofs&quot; of God's existence for centuries. Whether all of the theistic arguments have been refuted is a matter in dispute.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Throughout the centuries, theistic philosophers have offered logical arguments in support of God's existence. Most of these can be divided into four major classes - ontological, cosmological, teleological, and moral&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/] &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, atheists contend that these have been refuted.

There are also many atheists who attack specific forms of theism as being self-contradictory. One of the most common arguments against the existence of a specific God is the [[problem of evil]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The problem of evil is probably the most enduring and the most potent argument atheism has to offer against many varieties of theism. Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] aptly styled it ''atheism's killer argument''. In brief, it seeks to establish that the existence of evil in the world is logically incompatible with the existence of a benevolent God, and that it is more reasonable to conclude that God does not exist than that he does exist but does nothing to stop evil.&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/allpossibleworlds.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other well-known positive arguments include [[theological noncognitivism]], [[incoherency argument]]s (which seek to prove contradictions within the nature of &quot;god&quot;), atheistic teleological arguments, and the [[Transcendental argument for the non-existence of God]].

===Personal and social reasons===
As well as atheists with philosophical reasons, there are explicit atheists who cite social, psychological, practical, and other reasons for their beliefs.

Some people hold atheistic beliefs on the grounds that it is conducive towards living a better life, such as the belief that atheism is more ethical or useful than theism. Such atheists may hold that searching for explanations through natural science is more beneficial than doing it through faith.

Moral reasons for atheism include &quot;cases where the requirement to do what is right favors being an atheist, or at the very least, not supporting certain sects or practices of theism.'''...''' Those who cannot accept the notion of an evil god must conclude that any immoral religion is necessarily false.&quot; Practical reasons for atheism include &quot;reasons why accepting atheism over theism produces positive overall effects on a person's life.&quot; [http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/necessityofatheism.html]

Arguments that theism promotes immorality often center around the contention that a great deal of violence, including [[war]], has been brought about by religious beliefs and practices.

Some people are atheists at least partly because of growing up in an environment where atheism is relatively common, such as being raised by atheist parents.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Many people are atheists not because they've reasoned things out like that, but because of the way they were brought up or educated, or because they have simply adopted the beliefs of the culture in which they grew up.&quot; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/reasons/index.shtml BBC].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most atheists contend that the same is true for many believers. For instance, most of the population in predominantly Jewish, Muslim, or Christian countries follow the religion that is more prevalent without much questioning. &lt;!-- Cyclic logic. &quot;More people believe in Christianity in places where more people believe in Christianity.&quot; --&gt;

Christian psychologist Paul Vitz (1999) argues that, &quot;Many people have psychological reasons for atheism&quot; [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/frear/vitz.htm] and &quot;neurotic psychological barriers to belief in God are of great importance&quot; [http://www.origins.org/articles/vitz_psychologyofatheism.html]. See Vitz (1999) and, for a similar view, Rizzuto (1998). 

While it is common to point out the psychological reasons for not being an atheist, it is important to note that emotion and &quot;feelings&quot; play an important role for many people, not just theists. However, an understanding of the psychological origins for belief in a god may contribute to some atheists' lack of religious belief; see [[true believer syndrome]] and [[psychology of religion]].

===Historical reasons===
Without even taking into account scientific research, some atheists have come to the conclusion that the existence of one or more gods can be dismissed due to historical reasons. Looking at very old civilizations such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], people believed in multiple gods, linking each of them to an unexplained physical reality, such as [[Hades]] the god of the dead, [[Helios]] the god of the sun, [[Zeus]] the god of thunder and [[Poseidon]] the god of earthquakes. These people could not explain a phenomenon using a [[scientific theory]] and thus invented a god to explain it, from fear of the unexplained.

In our current times, all of these things, except one, have been explained scientifically. There are no significant group of people believing earthquakes are the direct action of a god shaking the [[Earth]]. The only item from the original gods that is still a near complete mystery is death, and as such only one god remains in most modern religions, and looking at the various religions, death (along with afterlife) is usually a central topic.

Looking at [[Historical persecution by Christians|historical records]], one can also see how the fears that people have of unexplained phenomenons have been used by various religious leaders both to persecute other religions, and to gain more believers. It seems likely to some atheists, that if the result of death could someday be explained beyond a reasonable doubt by science, the last god would no longer be worshiped by a majority of people, just as was the case for every previous mythical god.

==Criticisms of atheism==
{{main|Criticism of Atheism}}
Atheists and atheism have received much criticism and opposition, chiefly from theistic sources, throughout human history. Opponents of atheism have frequently associated atheism with immorality and evil, often characterizing it as a willful and malicious rejection of gods. This, in fact, is the original definition and sense of the word, but changing sensibilities and the normalization of nonreligious viewpoints have caused the term to lose its negative connotations, at least in secular cultures.

The most direct arguments against atheism are those in favor of the existence of deities, which would imply that atheism is simply untrue. For examples of this type of argument, see [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|Existence of God]]. 

Many common criticisms of atheism are rooted in a misunderstanding of what it is, or an incorrect assumption that all atheists are &quot;strong&quot; atheists who assert that there is no such thing as God anywhere in the universe. [[Ray Comfort]] exhibits this fallacy in &quot;The Atheist Test&quot; [http://ecclesia.org/truth/atheist.html]: ''&quot;To say 'There is no God,' and to be correct in the statement, I must be omniscient. I must know how many hairs are upon every head, every thought of every human heart, every detail of history, every atom within every rock...nothing is hidden from my eyes...I know the intimate details of the secret love-life of the fleas on the back of the black cat of Napoleon's great-grandmother. To make the absolute statement 'There is no God.' I must have absolute knowledge that there isn't one.&quot;&quot;

Other criticisms of atheism are based in conceptions that it leads to poor morals or ethics, that it is impossible for a person to truly have faith in nothing, or that lack of belief in a god is as much (or more) a leap of faith than belief in a god. These criticisms have been answered to the satisfaction of many atheists. [http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agnosticism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that the [[truth]]  or falsity of certain claims—particularly [[theology|theological]] claims regarding the existence of [[Monotheism|God]] or [[Polytheism|gods]]—is unknown, unknowable, or incoherent. Some agnostics infer from this that these claims are irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. 

The term and the related ''agnostic'' were coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in [[1869]], and are also used to describe those who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities as well as other matters of [[religion]]. The word agnostic comes from the Greek ''a'' (without) and ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge).  Agnosticism, focusing on what can be known, is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position (dealing with the nature and limits of human knowledge); while atheism and theism are [[ontology|ontological]] positions (a branch of metaphysics that deals with what types of entities exist).  Agnosticism is not to be confused with a view specifically opposing the doctrine of [[gnosis]] and [[Gnosticism]]&amp;mdash;these are religious concepts that are not generally related to agnosticism.

Agnosticism is distinct from [[strong atheism]] (also called ''positive atheism'' or ''dogmatic atheism''), which denies the existence of any deities. However, the more general variety of [[atheism]], [[weak atheism]] (also called ''negative atheism'', and sometimes ''neutral atheism''), professes only a lack of belief in a god or gods, which is not equivalent to but is compatible with agnosticism.  ''Critical atheism'' admits that a god or gods are meaningful concepts but the evidence for them is not in hand, so a default position of not believing in them must be taken in the interim.

Agnostics may claim that it isn't possible to have ''absolute'' or ''certain'' spiritual knowledge or, alternatively, that while certainty ''may'' be possible, they personally have no such knowledge. In both cases, agnosticism involves some form of [[philosophical scepticism|skepticism]] towards religious statements.  This is different from the simple [[irreligion]] of those who give no thought to the subject.

==Variations==
Agnosticism has suffered more than most expressions of philosophical position from terminological vagaries. Data collection services [http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Nonreligious], [http://cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2122.html] often display the common use of the term, distinct from strong atheism in its lack of disputing the existence of deities. Agnostics are listed alongside [[secularism|secular]], [[irreligion|non-religious]], or other such categories.

Other variations include:

* [[Strong agnosticism]] (also called hard agnosticism, closed agnosticism, strict agnosticism, absolute agnosticism)—the view that the question of the existence of deities is unknowable by nature or that human beings are ill-equipped to judge the evidence.
* [[Weak agnosticism]] (also called soft agnosticism, open agnosticism, empirical agnosticism, temporal agnosticism)—the view that the existence or nonexistence of God or gods is currently unknown but isn't necessarily unknowable, therefore one will withhold judgment until more evidence is available.
* [[Apathetic agnosticism]]—the view that there is no proof either of God's existence or nonexistence, but since God (if there is one) appears unconcerned for the universe or the welfare of its inhabitants, the question is largely academic.
* [[Ignosticism]]—the view that the concept of God as a being is meaningless because it has no verifiable consequences, therefore it cannot be usefully discussed as having existence or nonexistence. See [[scientific method]].
* Model agnosticism—the view that philosophical and metaphysical questions are not ultimately verifiable but that a model of malleable assumption should be built upon rational thought. This branch of agnosticism does not focus on a deity's existence.
* [[Agnostic theism]]—the view of those who do not claim to ''know'' God's existence, but still ''believe'' in his existence. (''See [[Epistemology#Knowledge_and_belief|Knowledge Vs Beliefs]]'') Whether this is truly agnosticism is disputed.  It may also imply the belief that although there is something that resembles (or would at least appear to us as) a god (or gods,) there remains doubt over their true nature, motives, or the validity of the claim to be 'God' rather than superior, supernatural being(s).
* [[Agnostic spiritualism]]—the view that there may or may not be a god (or gods,) while maintaining a general personal belief in a spiritual aspect of reality, particularly without distinct religious basis, or adherence to any established doctrine or dogma.
* [[Agnostic atheism]]—the view that God may or may not exist, but that his non-existence is more likely.  Some agnostic atheists would at least partially base their beliefs on [[Occam's Razor]].

==Some philosophical opinions==
Among the most famous agnostics (in the original sense) have been [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. Some have argued from the works of [[David Hume]], especially ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', that he was an agnostic, but this remains subject to debate. 

===Thomas Henry Huxley===
Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the &quot;unconditioned&quot; (Hamilton) and the &quot;unknowable&quot; ([[Herbert Spencer]]). It is important, therefore, to discover Huxley's own views on the matter. Though Huxley began to use the term &quot;agnostic&quot; in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:

:I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''[[a priori]]'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter. . . .

:It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions. . . .

:That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.

And again, to the same correspondent, [[May 6]], [[1863]]:

:I have never had the least sympathy with the ''a priori'' reasons against [[orthodoxy]], and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and [[infidel]] school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the [[Christian]] would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I&amp;mdash;who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds&amp;mdash;have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave (Coll. Ess. v. pp. 237-239) the following account:

:So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of &quot;agnostic.&quot; It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the &quot;gnostic&quot; of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant. To my great satisfaction the term took. 

Huxley's agnosticism is believed to be a natural consequence of the intellectual and philosophical conditions of the [[1860]]s, when clerical intolerance was trying to suppress scientific discoveries which appeared to clash with a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]] and other established [[Jewish]] and Christian doctrines. Agnosticism should not, however, be confused with [[natural theology]], [[deism]], [[pantheism]], or other science positive forms of [[theism]].

By way of clarification, Huxley states, &quot;In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable&quot; (Huxley, ''Agnosticism'', 1889). While A. W. Momerie has noted that this is nothing but a definition of [[honesty]], Huxley's usual definition goes beyond mere honesty to  insist that these metaphysical issues are fundamentally unknowable.

===Bertrand Russell===
[[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[pamphlet]], ''Why I Am Not a Christian,'' based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title,  is considered a classic statement of agnosticism. The essay briefly lays out Russell&amp;#8217;s objections to some of the [[arguments for the existence of God]] before discussing his moral objections to Christian teachings. He then calls upon his readers to &quot;stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world,&quot; with a &quot;fearless attitude and a free intelligence.&quot; 

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterised himself as an agnostic. He said:

:The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter. (Collected Papers, Vol 10, p.255) 

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:

:That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can. (p.258) 

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance In The Face Of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:

:As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God.

:On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

In his 1953 essay, ''What Is An Agnostic?'' Russell states: 

:An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.   

However, later in the essay, Russell says:

:I think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.

He didn't say &quot;supreme&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; intelligence: these terms are metaphysically loaded.  

For Russell, then, agnosticism doesn't necessarily assert that it is ''in principle'' impossible to know whether or not there is a God. Moreover, &quot;An Agnostic may think the Christian God as improbable as the Olympians; in that case, he is, for practical purposes, at one with the atheists.&quot;

===Logical positivism===
[[logical positivism|Logical positivists]], such as [[Rudolph Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], are sometimes thought to be agnostic. Using arguments reminiscent of [[Wittgenstein]]&amp;#8217;s famous &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent,&quot; they viewed any talk of god(s) as literally [[nonsense]]. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences could not have a truth value and were deemed to be without meaning. But this includes all utterances about 
god(s), ''even'' those agnostic statements that deny knowledge of God(s) are possible. In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' Ayer explicitly rejects agnosticism on the grounds that an agnostic, despite claiming that knowledge of god(s) are not possible, nevertheless holds that statements about god(s) have meaning. This position, however, is valid only in the case of agnostics who define their agnosticism in this fashion. ''[[Ignosticism|Ignostics]]'' define agnosticism in a manner consistent with the logical positivist view, holding theism to be ''incoherent.''

'''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]]. It has the symbol '''Ar''' and [[atomic number]] 18. The third [[noble gas]], in group 18, argon makes up about 1% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], making it the most common noble gas on Earth.

== Notable characteristics ==
Argon is 2.5 times as [[solubility|soluble]] in water as [[nitrogen]] which is approximately the same solubility as [[oxygen]]. This highly stable chemical element is colorless and odorless in both its liquid and gaseous forms.
There are few known true chemical compounds that contain argon, which is one of the reasons it was formerly called an inert gas. The creation of argon hydrofluoride (HArF), a highly unstable compound of argon with [[fluorine]], was reported by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 2000, but has not been confirmed as of yet.

Although no ''chemical'' compounds of argon are presently confirmed, argon can form [[clathrates]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules. Theoretical calculations on computers have shown several Argon compounds that should be stable but for which no synthesis routes are currently known.

== Applications ==
It is used in lighting since it will not react with the filament in a [[lightbulb]] even under high temperatures and other cases where diatomic nitrogen is an unsuitable (semi-)[[inert]] gas. Other uses;

*Argon is used as an inert gas shield in many forms of [[welding]], including [[metal inert gas welding|mig]] and [[Tungsten inert gas welding|tig]] (where the &quot;'''I'''&quot; stands for [[inert]]).
*as a non-reactive blanket in the manufacture of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements.
*as a protective atmosphere for growing [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] [[crystal]]s.
*as a gas for use in [[plasma globe | plasma globes]].
*as a gas for use in energy efficient [[window]]s.
*Argon-39 has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core|ice coring]]. It has also been used for [[ground water]] dating.
*[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] uses liquefied argon to destroy [[cancer]] cells.


Argon is also used in technical [[SCUBA]] diving to inflate the dry suit, because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.

== History ==
Argon ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''argos'' meaning &quot;inactive&quot;) was suspected to be present in air by [[Henry Cavendish]] in [[1785]] but was not discovered until [[1894]] by [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] and Sir [[William Ramsay]].

== Occurrence ==
This gas is isolated through liquid air fractionation since the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] contains only 0.934% volume of argon (1.29% mass). The [[Mars (planet)|Martian]] atmosphere in contrast contains 1.6% of Ar-40 and 5 [[part per million|ppm]] Ar-36. In 2005, the ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Huygens]]'' probe also discovered the presence of Ar-40 on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMHB881Y3E_index_0.html].

== Compounds ==
Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were generally considered to be chemically inert and not able to form compounds. However, since then, scientists have been able to force the heavier noble gases to form compounds. In 2000, the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]]. By shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, they were able to form argon hydrofluoride (HArF): see http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/noblegases.html in its paragraph starting &quot;''Many recent findings''&quot;. It is stable up to 40°[[kelvin|K]].

== Isotopes ==
The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are Ar-40, Ar-36, and Ar-38. Naturally occurring [[potassium|K]]-40 with a [[half-life]] of 1.250 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, decays to stable Ar-40 (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] and by [[positron emission]], and also transforms to stable Ca-40 (88.8%) via [[beta decay]]. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s.

In the Earth's atmosphere, Ar-39 is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily with Ar-40. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by K-39 or [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] by [[calcium]]. Argon-37 is created from the decay of calcium-40 as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.

'''Arsenic''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''As''' and [[atomic number]] 33. This is a notoriously poisonous [[metalloid]] that has three [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms; yellow, black and grey. Arsenic and its compounds are used as [[pesticides]], [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and various [[alloy]]s.

== Notable characteristics ==
Arsenic is very similar chemically to its predecessor [[phosphorus]], so much so that it will partly substitute for [[phosphorus]] in biochemical reactions and is thus [[poison]]ous. When heated it rapidly [[oxidation|oxidizes]] to [[arsenic trioxide]], which has a garlic odor. Arsenic and some arsenic compounds can also [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublime]] upon heating, converting directly to a gaseous form. Elemental arsenic is found in two solid forms: yellow and gray/metallic, with [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] of 1.97 and 5.73, respectively.

== Applications ==
[[Lead hydrogen arsenate]] has been used, well into the [[20th century]], as an [[insecticide]] on [[fruit tree]]s (resulting in [[neurological damage]] to those working the sprayers), and [[Scheele's Green]] has even been recorded in the [[19th century]] as a [[food dye|coloring agent]] in [[sweets]].  In the last half century, [[monosodium methyl arsenate]] (MSMA), a less toxic organic form of arsenic, has replaced lead arsenate's role in agriculture.

The application of most concern to the general public is probably that of [[wood]] which has been treated with [[chromated copper arsenate]] (&quot;CCA&quot;, or &quot;[[Tanalith]]&quot;, and the vast majority of older &quot;[[lumber#Preservatives|pressure treated]]&quot; wood). CCA timber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the [[20th century]] as a structural, and outdoor [[building material]], where there was a risk of [[rot]], or [[insect]] infestation in untreated timber. Although widespread bans followed the publication of studies which showed low-level leaching from in-situ timbers (such as children's [[playground]] equipment) into surrounding [[soil]], the most serious risk is presented by the burning of CCA timber. Recent years have seen fatal animal poisonings, and serious human poisonings resulting from the ingestion - directly or indirectly - of wood ash from CCA timber (the lethal human dose is approximately 20 grams of ash - roughly a tablespoon). Scrap CCA construction timber continues to be widely burnt through ignorance, in both commercial, and domestic fires. Safe disposal of CCA timber remains patchy, and little practiced, there is concern in some quarters about the widespread [[landfill]] disposal of such timber.

During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds have been used as medicines, including [[arsphenamine]] (by [[Paul Ehrlich]]) and [[arsenic trioxide]] (by Thomas Fowler).
Arsphenamine as well as [[Neosalvarsan]] was indicated for [[syphilis]] and [[trypanosomiasis]], but has been superseded by modern [[antibiotics]].
Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 200 years, but most commonly in the treatment of cancer.  The [[FDA]] in 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]] that is resistant to [[all-trans retinoic acid|ATRA]].{{an|ArsTriChemo}}

But arsenic isn't always good for [[cancer]]. Some studies show that if you use arsenic you have a high risk for cancer.

Copper acetoarsenite was used as a green [[pigment]] known under many different names, including [[Paris Green]] and Emerald Green. It caused numerous [[arsenic poisoning]]s.

Other uses;
* Various [[agriculture|agricultural]] insecticides and poisons.
* [[Gallium arsenide]] is an important [[semiconductor]] material, used in [[integrated circuit]]s. Circuits made using the compound are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made in [[silicon]]. Unlike silicon it is [[direct bandgap]], and so can be used in [[laser diode]]s and [[LED]]s to directly convert [[electricity]] into [[light]].
* Arsenic trioxide is used in [[Australia]] for treating [[termite]] infestations in houses.
* Also used in [[bronzing]] and [[pyrotechny]].

== History ==
The word ''arsenic'' is borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word زرنيخ ''Zarnikh'' meaning &quot;yellow [[orpiment]]&quot;. ''Zarnikh'' was borrowed by [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''arsenikon''. Arsenic has been known and used in [[Iran|Persia]] and elsewhere since ancient times. As the symptoms of [[arsenic poisoning]] were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for [[murder]] until the advent of the [[Marsh test]], a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the [[Reinsch test]].)  Due to its use by the ruling class to bump each other off and its incredible potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the ''Poison of Kings and the King of Poisons''.

During the Bronze Age, arsenic was often included in the bronze (mostly as an impurity), which made the alloy harder.

[[Albertus Magnus]] is believed to have been the first to isolate the
element in [[1250]]. In [[1649]] [[Johann Schroeder]] published two ways of preparing arsenic.

[[image:arsenic-symbol.png|75px|right|Alchemical symbol for arsenic]]The [[alchemy|alchemical]] symbol for arsenic is shown opposite.

In Victorian times, arsenic was mixed with [[vinegar]] and [[chalk]] and eaten by women to improve the [[complexion]] of their faces, making their skin more fair to show they did not work in the fields.  Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to improve their complexion.

There is a massive epidemic of arsenic poisoning in [[Bangladesh]]{{an|bangladesh}}, where it is estimated that approximately 57 million people are drinking [[groundwater]] with arsenic concentrations elevated above the [[World Health Organization]]'s standard of 50 [[Concentration#.22Parts-per.22 Notation|parts per billion]]. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater due to the anoxic conditions of the subsurface. This groundwater began to be used after western [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s instigated a massive tube [[Water well|well]] drinking-water program in the late [[twentieth century]]. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacterially-contaminated surface waters, but unfortunately failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater.(2) Many other countries in [[Southeast Asia|South East Asia]], such as [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Tibet]], are thought to have geological environments similarly conducive to generation of high-arsenic groundwaters.

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:Native arsenic.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Massive native arsenic]]
[[Arsenopyrite]] also called mispickel ([[iron|Fe]][[sulfur|S]]As) is the most common [[mineral]] from which, on heating, the arsenic sublimes leaving ferrous sulfide. Other arsenic minerals include [[realgar]], [[mimetite]], [[cobaltite]] and [[erythrite]].

The most important compounds of arsenic are [[white arsenic]], its [[arsenic sulfide|sulfide]], [[Paris Green]], [[calcium arsenate]], and [[lead hydrogen arsenate]]. Paris Green, calcium arsenate, and lead arsenate have been used as [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[insecticide]]s and [[poison]]s. It is sometimes found native, but usually combined with [[silver]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[antimony]], or [[sulfur]].

In addition to the inorganic forms mentioned above, arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment. Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the [[food chain]], are progressively metabolised to a less toxic form of arsenic through a process of [[methylation]].

== Precautions ==

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Arsenic kills by [[allosteric inhibition]] of the metabolic [[enzyme]] [[lipothiamide pyrophosphate]], leading to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. See [[arsenic poisoning]]. Arsenic and its compounds inhibit the , which is an important enzyme of metabolism. The [[post mortem]] reveals brick red colored [[mucosa]], due to severe [[haemorrhage]].  

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as '''''[[toxic]]''''' and '''''dangerous for the environment''''' in the [[European Union]] under [[directive 67/548/EEC]].
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-001-00-X (arsenic) R23/25-50/53; S1/2-20/21-28-45-60-61 --&gt;
&lt;!-- INDEX 033-002-00-5 (other compounds) pareil --&gt;

The [[IARC]] recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|group 1 carcinogens]], and the EU lists [[arsenic trioxide]], [[arsenic pentoxide]] and [[arsenate]] salts as category 1 [[carcinogen]]s.

Growing the [[Brake (fern)]] [[Pteris vittata]] will remove arsenic from the soil.

'''Antimony''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Sb''' ([[Latin (language)|L.]] ''Stibium'') and [[atomic number]] 51. A [[metalloid]], antimony has four allotropic forms. The stable form of antimony is a blue-white metal. Yellow and black antimony are unstable non-metals. Antimony is used in flame-proofing, [[paint]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, a wide variety of [[alloy]]s, [[electronics]], and [[rubber]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Antimony in its elemental form is a silvery white, [[brittle]], [[fusibility|fusible]], [[crystal|crystalline]] solid that exhibits poor electrical and heat [[conductivity]] properties and [[vaporize]]s at low [[temperature]]s. A [[metalloid]], antimony resembles a metal in its appearance and physical properties, but does not chemically react as a metal. It is also attacked by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] [[acid]]s and [[halogen]]s. Antimony and some of its alloys expand on cooling.

Estimates of the abundance of antimony in the [[Earth]]'s crust range from 0.2 to 0.5 [[part per million|ppm]].  Antimony is geochemically categorized as a [[chalcophile]], occurring with [[sulfur]] and the [[heavy metals]] [[lead]], [[copper]], and [[silver]].

== Applications ==
Antimony is increasingly being used in the [[semiconductor]] industry in the production of [[diode]]s, [[infrared]] detectors, and [[Hall effect|Hall-effect]] devices. As an [[alloy]], this semi-metal  greatly increases [[lead]]'s hardness and mechanical strength. The most important use of antimony metal is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries. Other uses;
*[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]],
*antifriction alloys,
*type metal,
*small arms and tracer bullets,
*cable sheathing,
*matches,
*medicines,
*plumbing (&quot;lead-free&quot; solder contains 5% Sb),
*main and big-end bearings in [[internal combustion engine]]s (as alloy).
*used in the past to treat [[Schistosomiasis]], nowadays [[Praziquantel]] is universally used.

Antimony compounds in the form of [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, sodium antimonate, and antimony trichloride are used in the making of flame-proofing compounds, [[ceramic]] enamels, [[glass]], [[paint]]s, and [[pottery]]. Antimony trioxide is the most important of the antimony compounds and is primarily used in flame-retardant formulations.  These flame-retardant applications include such markets as children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. Also, antimony sulfide is one of the ingredients of a modern match.

== History ==
Antimony was recognized in antiquity ([[4th_millennium_BC|3000 BC]] or earlier) in various compounds, and it was prized for its fine [[casting]] qualities. It was first reported scientifically by [[Tholden]] in [[1450]], and was known to be a metal by the beginning of the [[17th century]].  The origin of the name &quot;antimony&quot; is not clear; the term may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words &quot;anti&quot; and &quot;monos&quot;, which approximately means &quot;opposed to solitude&quot; as it was thought never to exist in its pure form, or from the [[Egyptian mythology|Pharaonic]] expression &quot;Antos Amun&quot;, which could be translated as &quot;bloom of the god [[Amun]]&quot;.

[[image:antimony-symbol.png|frame|left|80px|Alchemical symbol for antimony]]

The natural sulfide of antimony, [[stibnite]], was known and used in Biblical times as [[medicine]] and as a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]].  Stibnite is still used in some developing countries as [[medicine]]. Antimony has been used for the treatment of [[schistosomiasis]]. Antimony attaches itself to [[sulfur]] atoms in certain [[enzyme]]s which are used both by the parasite and human host. Small doses can kill the parasite without causing damage to the patient. Antimony and its compounds are used in several[[ veterinary]] preparations like Anthiomaline or Lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants. Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues, at least in animals. Tartar emetic is another antimony preparation which is used as an anti-schistosomal drug.

The relationship between antimony's modern name and its symbol is complex; the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] name for the cosmetic powder antimony sulfide was borrowed by the [[Greece|Greeks]], which was in turn borrowed by [[Latin]], resulting in ''stibium''.  The chemical pioneer [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] used an abbreviation of this name for antimony in his writings, and his usage became the standard symbol.

Treatments chiefly involving antimony have been called [[antimonial]]s.

== Sources ==
[[Image:Antimony massive.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Native massive antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]]
Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 [[mineral]] species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide [[stibnite]] (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is the predominant ore [[mineral]]. Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots, broken pieces, granules, and cast cake. Other forms are powder, shot, and single crystals.

== Precautions ==
Antimony and many of its compounds are [[toxic]]. Clinically, antimony poisoning is very similar to [[arsenic]] poisoning. In small doses, antimony causes [[headache]], [[dizziness]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Such small doses have in the past been reported in some acidic fruit drinks. The acidic nature of the drink is sufficient to dissolve small amounts of antimony oxide contained in the packaging of the drink; modern manufacturing methods prevent this occurrence. Larger doses cause violent and frequent vomiting, and will lead to death in few days.  Very large doses will cause violent vomiting, causing the poison to be expelled from the body before any harm is done.

'''Actinium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol Ac and [[atomic number]] 89.

==Notable characteristics==
Actinium is a silvery radioactive metallic element. Due to its intense radioactivity, Actinium glows in the dark with an eerie blue light. It is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227-Ac, an [[alpha radiation|&amp;alpha;]] and [[beta radiation|&amp;beta; emitter]] with a [[half-life]] of 21.773 years. One ton of [[uranium]] ore contains about a tenth of a gram of actinium.

==Applications==
It is about 150 times as radioactive as radium, making it valuable as a [[neutron source]]. Otherwise it has no significant industrial applications.

Actinium-225 is used in medicine to produce Bi-213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radio-immunotherapy.

==History==
Actinium was discovered in [[1899]] by [[André-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, who separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]]. [[Friedrich Otto Giesel]] independently discovered actinium in [[1902]]. The chemical behavior of actinium is similar to that of the rare earth [[lanthanum]].

The word actinium comes from the Greek ''aktis, aktinos'', meaning beam or ray.

==Occurrence==
Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226-Ra in a nuclear reactor. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300ºC.

==Isotopes==
Naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive [[isotope]]; &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. 36 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being 227-Ac with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 [[years|y]], 225-Ac with a half-life of 10.0 [[day]]s, and 226-Ac with a half-life of 29.37 [[hours|h]].  All of the remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lifes that are less than 10 hours and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 1 minute. The shortest-lived isotope of actinium is&lt;sup&gt;217&lt;/sup&gt;Ac which decays through [[alpha decay]] and [[electron capture]]. It has a half-life of 69 [[nanoseconds|ns]]. Actinium also has 2 [[meta state]]s.

Purified actinium-227 comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days, and then decays according to its 21.773-year half-life.

The isotopes of actinium range in [[atomic weight]] from 206 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] (&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;actinium) to 236 amu (&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Ac).

==Precautions==
Actinium-227 is extremely radioactive, and in terms of its potential for radiation induced health effects, actinium-227 is about as dangerous as plutonium. Ingesting even small amounts of actinium-227 would present a serious health hazard.

'''Americium''' is a [[synthetic element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol Am and [[atomic number]] 95. A [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[metal]]lic element, americium is an [[actinide]] that was obtained by bombarding [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s and was the fourth [[transuranic element]] to be discovered. It was named for the [[The Americas|America]]s, by analogy with [[europium]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Freshly prepared americium [[metal]] has a white and silvery [[luster]], at [[room temperature]]s it slowly tarnishes in dry air. It is more silvery than [[plutonium]] or [[neptunium]] and apparently more malleable than neptunium or [[uranium]]. [[Alpha emission]] from Am-241 is approximately three times [[radium]].  [[Gram]] quantities of Am-241 emit intense [[gamma ray]]s which creates a serious exposure problem for anyone handling the element.

== Applications ==
This element can be produced in [[kilogram]] amounts and has some uses (mostly Am-241 since it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope). Americium has found its way into the household, where one type of [[smoke detector]] contains a tiny amount of Am-241 as a source of [[ionizing radiation]]. Am-241 has been used as a portable gamma ray source for use in [[radiography]]. The element has also been employed to gauge [[glass]] thickness to help create flat glass.  Am-242 is a neutron emitter and has found uses in [[neutron radiography]].  However this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities.

== History ==
Americium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and [[Albert Ghiorso]] in late [[1944]] at the wartime Metallurgical Laboratory at the [[University of Chicago]] (now known as [[Argonne National Laboratory]]). The team created the [[isotope]] Am-241 by subjecting [[plutonium]]-239 to successive [[neutron capture]] reactions in a [[nuclear reactor]]. This created Pu-240 and then Pu-241 which in turn decayed into Am-241 via [[beta decay]].  Seaborg was granted [[patent]] 3,156,523 for &quot;Element 95 and Method of Producing Said Element&quot;. The discovery of americium and [[curium]] was first announced informally on a children's quiz show in 1945. [http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/print/americiumprint.html]

== Isotopes ==
18 [[radioisotope]]s of americium have been characterized, with the most stable being Am-243 with a [[half-life]] of 7370 years, and Am-241 with a half-life of 432.2 years. All of the remaining [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 51 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 100 minutes. This element also has 8 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being Am-242m (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; 141 years). The isotopes of americium range in [[atomic weight]] from 231.046 [[atomic mass unit|amu]] (Am-231) to 249.078 amu (Am-249).

== Chemistry ==

In aqueous systems the most common oxidation state is +3, it is very much harder to oxidise Am(III) to Am(IV) than it is to do the same oxidation for Pu(III).

Currently the [[solvent extraction]] chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world [[scientists]] are working on reducing the medium term [[radiotoxicity]] of the waste from the reprocessing of used [[nuclear fuel]].

See [[liquid-liquid extraction]] for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium.


Americium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide americyl core (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[http://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00818038.pdf].  In the environment, this americyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.

*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
*AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Astatine''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''At''' and [[atomic number]] 85. This [[radioactive]] element occurs naturally from [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] decay and is the heaviest of the [[halogen]]s.

== Notable characteristics ==
This highly [[radioactive]] element has been confirmed by [[mass spectrometer]]s to behave chemically much like other [[halogen]]s, especially [[iodine]] (it would probably accumulate in the [[thyroid]] gland like iodine). Astatine is thought to be more [[metal]]lic than iodine. Researchers at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] have performed experiments that have identified and measured elementary reactions that involve astatine.

With the possible exception of [[francium]], astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than 1 [[ounce|oz]] (28 g) at any one time; this amounts to less than one teaspoon of the element. The [[Guinness Book of Records]], however, has dubbed the element the rarest on Earth, stating: &quot;Only around 0.9 oz (25 [[gram|g]]) of the element astatine (At) occurs naturally in the Earth's crust.&quot;

== History ==
Astatine ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''astatos'' meaning &quot;unstable&quot;) was first synthesized in [[1940]] by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[K. R. MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by barraging [[bismuth]] with [[alpha particle]]s. An earlier name for the element was ''alabamine'' (Ab).

== Occurrence ==
Astatine is produced by bombarding bismuth with energetic alpha particles to obtain relatively long-lived At-209 - At-211, which can then be [[distillation|distilled]] from the target by heating in the presence of air.

== Isotopes ==
Astatine has 41 known [[isotope]]s, all of which are [[radioactive]]; the longest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;At which has a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. The shortest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;At which has a half-life of 125 [[nanoseconds]].

In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], an '''atom''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''&amp;#940;&amp;#964;&amp;#959;&amp;#956;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;'' meaning &quot;indivisible&quot;) is the smallest possible particle of a [[chemical element]] that retains its chemical properties. The word ''atom'' may also refer to the smallest possible indivisible [[fundamental particle]]. This definition must not be confused with that of chemical atoms, since chemical atoms (hereafter &quot;atoms&quot;) are composed of smaller [[subatomic particle]]s.

Most atoms are composed of three types of [[subatomic particle]]s which govern their external properties:
* [[electron]]s, which have a negative [[electric charge|charge]] and are the least massive of the three;
* [[proton]]s, which have a positive [[electric charge|charge]] and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and
* [[neutron]]s, which have no [[electric charge|charge]] and are about 1838 times more massive than electrons.

Protons and neutrons are both [[nucleon]]s and make up the dense, massive [[atomic nucleus]]. The electrons form the much larger [[electron cloud]] surrounding the nucleus.

Atoms differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. The number of protons in an atom (called the [[atomic number]]) determines the [[chemical element|element]] of the atom. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may also vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ions]]. The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus may also change, via [[nuclear fusion]], [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]].

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of [[chemistry]], and are [[Law of Conservation of Matter|conserved]] in [[chemical reaction]]s. Atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s. Molecules are made up of multiple atoms; for example, a molecule of [[water]] is a combination of two [[hydrogen]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom.

==Properties of the atom==
===Subatomic particles===
:''see main article [[subatomic particle]]s

Although the name &quot;atom&quot; was applied at a time when atoms were thought to be indivisible, it is now known that the atom can be broken down into a number of smaller components. The first of these to be discovered was the negatively charged [[electron]], which is easily ejected from atoms during [[ionization]]. The electrons orbit a small, dense body containing all of the positive charge in the atom, called the [[atomic nucleus]]. This nucleus is itself made up of [[nucleon]]s: positively charged [[proton]]s and chargeless [[neutron]]s.

Before 1961, the subatomic particles were thought to consist of only protons, neutrons and electrons. However, protons and neutrons themselves are now known to consist of still smaller particles called [[quark]]s. In addition, the electron is known to have a nearly massless neutral partner called a [[neutrino]]. Together, the electron and neutrino are both [[lepton]]s.

Ordinary atoms are composed only of quarks and leptons of the first [[generation (particle physics)|generation]]. The proton is composed of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], whereas the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks. Although they do not occur in ordinary matter, two other heavier generations of quarks and leptons may be generated in [[high-energy physics|high-energy collisions]].

The subatomic [[force carrier|force carrying]] particles (called [[gauge boson]]s) are also important to atoms. Electrons are bound to the nucleus by [[photon]]s carrying the [[electromagnetic force]]. Protons and neutrons are bound together in the nucleus by [[gluon]]s carrying the [[strong nuclear force]].

====Electron configuration====
:''see main article [[electron configuration]]''

The [[chemistry|chemical behavior]] of atoms is due to interactions between electrons. Electrons of an atom remain within certain, predictable [[electron configurations]]. These configurations are determined by the [[quantum mechanics]] of electrons in the [[electric potential]] of the atom; the [[principal quantum number]] determines particular [[electron shell]]s with distinct [[energy level]]s. Generally, the higher the energy level of a shell, the further away it is from the nucleus. The electrons in the outermost shell, called the [[valence electron]]s, have the greatest influence on chemical behavior. Core electrons (those not in the outer shell) play a role, but it is usually in terms of a secondary effect due to screening of the positive charge in the atomic nucleus.

[[Image:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|right|The [[atomic orbital]] [[wavefunction]]s of a [[hydrogen atom]]. The [[principal quantum number]] is at the right of each row and the [[azimuthal quantum number]] is denoted by letter at top of each column.]]

An electron shell can hold up to 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons, where ''n'' is the principal quantum number of the shell. The occupied shell of greatest ''n'' is the valence shell, even if it only has one electron. In the most stable [[ground state]], an atom's electrons will fill up its shells in order of increasing energy. Under some circumstances an electron may be [[excited state|excited]] to a higher energy level (that is, it absorbs energy from an external source and leaps to a higher shell), leaving a space in a lower shell. An excited atom's electrons will [[spontaneous emission|spontaneously fall]] into lower levels, emitting excess energy as a [[photon]]s, until it returns to the ground state.

In addition to its principal quantum number ''n'', an electron is distinguished by three other quantum numbers: the [[azimuthal quantum number]] ''l'' (describing the [[orbital angular momentum]] of the electron), the [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m'' (describing the direction of the angular momentum vector), and the [[spin quantum number]] ''s'' (describing the direction of the electron's [[spin (physics)|intrinsic angular momentum]]). Electrons with varying ''l'' and ''m'' have distinctive shapes denoted by [[spectroscopic notation]]. In the illustration, the letters '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' (corresponding to ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3) describe the shape of the [[atomic orbital]]. In most atoms, orbitals of differing ''l'' are not exactly [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]] but separated into a [[fine structure]]. Orbitals of differing ''m'' are degenerate but may be separated by applying a [[magnetic field]], creating the [[Zeeman effect]]. Electrons with differing ''s'' have very slight energy differences called [[hyperfine splitting]].

====Nucleon properties====

The constituent [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s of the [[atomic nucleus]] are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The nucleons are held together in the nucleus by the [[strong nuclear force]].

Nuclei can undergo transformations that affect the number of protons and neutrons they contain, a process called [[radioactive decay]]. When nuclei transformations take place spontaneously, this process is called [[radioactivity]]. Radioactive transformations proceed by a wide variety of modes, but the most common are [[alpha decay]] (emission of a [[helium]] nucleus) and [[beta decay]] (emission of an electron). Decays involving electrons or [[positron]]s are due to the [[weak nuclear interaction]].

In addition, like the electrons of the atom, the nucleons of nuclei may be pushed into [[excited state]]s of higher energy. However, these transitions typically require thousands of times more energy than electron excitations. When an excited nucleus emits a photon to return to the [[ground state]], the photon has very high energy and is called a [[gamma ray]].

Nuclear transformations also take place in [[nuclear reaction]]s. In [[nuclear fusion]], two light nuclei come together and merge into a single heavier nucleus. In [[nuclear fission]], a single large nucleus is divided into two or more smaller nuclei.

===Atom size and speed===
Atoms are much smaller than the [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] that human vision can detect, so atoms cannot be seen in any kind of optical [[microscope]]. However, there are ways of detecting the positions of atoms on the surface of a solid or a [[thin film]] so as to obtain images. These include: [[electron microscope]]s (such as in [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM)), [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM), [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[x-ray microscopy]].

Since the [[electron cloud]] does not have a sharp cutoff, the size of an atom is not easily defined. For atoms that can form solid [[crystal]] [[crystal lattice|lattice]]s, the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms can be easily determined by [[x-ray diffraction]], giving an estimate of the atoms' size. For any atom, one might use the radius at which the electrons of the [[valence shell]] are most likely to be found. As an example, the size of a [[hydrogen]] atom is estimated to be approximately 1.0586&amp;times;10{{smsup|−10}}&amp;nbsp;m (twice the [[Bohr radius]]). Compare this to the size of the [[proton]] (the only particle in the nucleus of the hydrogen atom), which is approximately 10{{smsup|−15}}&amp;nbsp;m. So the ratio of the size of the hydrogen atom to its nucleus is about 100,000:1.  If an atom were the size of a [[stadium]], the nucleus would be the size of a [[marbles|marble]]. Nearly all the mass of an atom is in its nucleus, yet almost all the space in an atom is filled by its electrons.

Atoms of different [[chemical element|elements]] do vary in size, but the sizes do not scale linearly with the mass of the atom. Their sizes are roughly the same to within a factor of 2. The reason for this is that heavy elements have large positive charge on their nuclei, which strongly attract the electrons to the center of the atom. This contracts the size of the [[electron shell]]s, so that more electrons fit in the only a slightly greater volume.
  
The [[temperature]] of a collection of atoms is a measure of the average energy of motion of those atoms; at 0 [[kelvin]]s ([[absolute zero]]) atoms would have no motion. As the temperature of the system is increased, the kinetic energy of the particles in the system is increased, and their speed of motion increases. At [[room temperature]], atoms making up gases in the air move at a speed of 500&amp;nbsp;m/s (about 1100 mph or 1800 km/h).

===Elements, isotopes and ions===

Atoms are generally classified by their [[atomic number]] ''Z'', which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom. The atomic number determines which [[chemical element]] the atom is. For example, [[carbon]] atoms are atoms containing six protons. All atoms with the same atomic number share a wide variety of physical properties and exhibit the same [[chemical properties]]. The elements may be sorted according to the [[periodic table]] in order of increasing atomic number.

The [[atomic mass]] ''A'', atomic mass number, or nucleon number of an element is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom of that element, so-called because each proton and neutron has a mass of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[amu]]. The number of neutrons ''A''−''Z'' in an atom has no effect on which element it is. Each element can have numerous kinds of atoms with the same number of protons and electrons but varying numbers of neutrons. Each has the same atomic number but a different mass number. These are called the [[isotope]]s of an element. When writing the name of an isotope, the element name is followed by the mass number. For example, [[carbon-14]] contains 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom, for a total mass number of 14.

The atomic mass listed for each element in the periodic table is an average of the isotope masses found in nature, [[weighted average|weighted]] by their [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]].

The simplest atom is the [[hydrogen]] isotope [[protium]], which has atomic number 1 and atomic mass number 1; it consists of one proton and one electron. The hydrogen isotope which also contains one neutron so is called [[deuterium]] or hydrogen-2; the hydrogen isotope with two neutrons is called [[tritium]] or hydrogen-3. Tritium is an unstable isotope which decays through a process called [[radioactivity]]. Almost all isotopes of each element are radioactive; only a few are [[stable isotope|stable]]. The elements with atomic number 84 ([[polonium]]) and heavier have no stable isotopes and are all radioactive.

Virtually all elements heavier than hydrogen and [[helium]] were created through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. Most of the elements lighter than [[uranium]] (''Z''=92) have stable-enough isotopes to occur naturally on [[Earth]] (with the notable exception of [[technetium]] ''Z''=43). Several elements that do not occur on Earth have been found to be present in [[star]]s. Elements not normally found in nature have been artificially created by [[synthetic element|nuclear bombardment]]; [[as of 2006]], elements have been created through atomic number 116 (given the temporary name [[ununhexium]]). These ultra-heavy elements are generally highly unstable and decay quickly.

Atoms that have either lost or gained electrons are called atomic [[ion]]s (with either positive(+) or negative charge(−), respectively).

===Valence and bonding===
:''see main article [[valence electron]]s and [[chemical bond]]''

The number of electrons in an atom's outermost shell (the [[valence shell]]) governs its bonding behavior. Therefore, elements with the same number of valence electrons are [[periodic table group|group]]ed together in the columns of the [[periodic table]] of the elements. [[Alkali metal]]s contain one electron on their outer shell; [[alkaline earth metal]]s, two electrons; [[halogen]]s, seven electrons; and various others. 

Every atom is most stable with a full valence shell. This means that atoms with full valence shells (the [[noble gas]]es) are very unreactive. Conversely, atoms with few electrons in their valence shell are more [[reactivity|reactive]] it is. Alkali metals are therefore very reactive, with [[caesium]], [[rubidium]], and [[francium]] being the most reactive of all metals. Also, atoms that need only few electrons (such as the halogens) to fill their valence shells are reactive. [[Fluorine]] is the most reactive of all elements.

Atoms may fill their valence shells by [[chemical bond]]ing. This can be achieved one of two ways: an atom can either share electrons with other atoms (a ''[[covalent bond]]''), or it can remove electrons from (or donate electrons to) other atoms (an ''[[ionic bond]]''). The formation of a bond causes a strong attraction between two atoms, creating [[molecule]]s or [[ionic compound]]s. Many other types of bonds exist, including:
*[[polar covalent bond]]s;
*[[coordinate covalent bond]]s;
*[[metallic bond]]s;
*[[hydrogen bond]]s; and
*[[van der Waals bond]]s.

===Atomic spectrum===
:''see main article [[Atomic spectroscopy]]''

Since each element in the [[periodic table]] consists of an atom in a unique configuration with different numbers of [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s, each element can also be uniquely described by the [[energy level|energies]] of its [[atomic orbital]]s and the number of electrons within them. Normally, an atom is found in its lowest-energy [[ground state]]; states with higher energy are called [[excited state]]s. An electron may move from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-energy orbital by absorbing a [[photon]] with energy equal to the difference between the energies of the two levels. An electron in a higher-energy orbital may drop to a lower-energy orbital by emitting a photon. Since each element has a unique set of energy levels, each creates its own [[light]] pattern unique to itself: its own spectral signature.  

If a set of atoms is heated (such as in an [[arc lamp]]), their electrons will move into excited states. When these atoms fall back toward the ground state, they will produce an [[emission spectrum]]. If a set of atoms is illuminated by a [[continuous spectrum]], it will only absorb specific [[wavelength]]s (energies) of photon that correspond to the differences in its energy levels. The resulting pattern of gaps is called the [[absorption spectrum]].

In spectroscopic analysis, scientists can use a [[spectrometer]] to study the atoms in [[star]]s and other distant objects. Due to the distinctive spectral lines that each element produces, they are able to tell the chemical composition of distant [[planet]]s, stars and [[nebula]]e.

Not all parts of the atomic spectrum are in visible light part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. For example, the [[hyperfine transition]]s (including the important [[21 cm line]]) produce low-energy [[radio wave]]s. When electrons deep inside large atoms are knocked out (for example by [[beta radiation]]), replacement atoms fall deep into the [[electric potential]] of the [[nucleus]], producing high-energy [[x-ray]]s.

==Atoms and antimatter==
:''see main article [[antimatter]]

[[Antimatter]] can also form atoms, composed of [[positron]]s, antiprotons, and antineutrons. Since antimatter is very difficult to produce and store, only a small amount [[antihydrogen]] has ever existed on Earth. This was produced at [[CERN]] in the [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]] experiments using the [[Antiproton Decelerator]].

==Atoms and the Big Bang==

In models of the [[Big Bang]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts that within one to three minutes of the Big Bang almost all atomic material in the universe was created. During this process, [[nucleus|nuclei]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] formed abundantly, but almost no elements heavier than [[lithium]]. Hydrogen makes up approximately 75% of the atoms in the universe; helium makes up 24%; and all other elements make up just 1%. However, although nuclei (fully-[[ion]]ized atoms) were created, neutral atoms themselves could not form in the intense heat.

Big Bang chronology of the atom continues to approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang when the cosmic temperature had dropped to just 3,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]]. It was then cool enough to allow the nuclei to capture [[electron]]s. This process is called [[recombination]], during which the first neutral atoms took form. Once atoms become neutral, they only absorb [[photon]]s of a discrete [[absorption spectrum]]. This allows most of the photons in the universe to travel unimpeded for billions of years. These photons are still detectable today in the [[cosmic microwave background]].

After Big Bang nucleosynthesis, no heavier elements could be created until the [[star formation|formation of the first stars]]. These stars [[nuclear fusion|fused]] heavier elements through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] during their lives and through [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] as they died. The seeding of the [[interstellar medium]] by heavy elements eventually allowed the formation of [[terrestrial planet]]s like the [[Earth]].

==History of atomic theory==
{{main|Atomic theory}}

===Early atomism===
From the [[6th century BC]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]]a philosophers in [[ancient India]] developed the earliest atomic theories. The first philosopher who formulated ideas about the atom in a systematic manner was [[Kanada]] who lived in the 6th century BC. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayana who also lived in the 6th century BC and was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]], had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. Indian atomists believed that an atom could be one of upto six elements, with each element having upto 24 properties. They developed detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, and had particularly elaborate theories of how atoms combine, which explains how atoms first combine in pairs, and then group into trios of pairs, which are the smallest visible units of matter. This parallels with the structure of modern atomic theory, in which pairs or triplets of supposedly fundamental quarks combine to create most typical forms of matter. They had also suggested the possibility of splitting an atom which, as we know today, is the source of atomic energy. (See [[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]] for more details.)

[[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]], [[Greek philosophers]] in the [[5th century BC]], presented a theory of atoms. (See [[Atomism]] for more details.) The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes, which determined the physical properties of the material.  For instance, the atoms of a [[liquid]] were thought to be smooth, allowing them to slide over each other. None of these ideas, however, were founded in [[scientific method|scientific experimentation]].

During the [[Middle Ages]] (the [[Islamic Golden Age]]), [[Islam]]ic atomists develop atomic theories that represent a synthesis of both Greek and Indian atomism. (See [[Atomism|Islamic atomism]] for more details.) Older Greek and Indian ideas were further developed by Islamic atomists, along with new Islamic ideas, such as the possibility of there being particles smaller than an atom. As Islamic influence began spreading through Europe, the ideas of Islamic atomism, along with the older ideas of Greek and Indian atomism, spread throughout Europe by the end of the Middle Ages, where modern atomic theories began taking shape.

===Birth of modern atomic theory===

In 1808, [[John Dalton]] proposed that an [[element]] is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and that although their shape and structure was immutable, atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ([[chemical compound]]s). He deduced this after the experimental discovery of the [[law of multiple proportions]] — that is, if two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small [[whole number]]s.

The experiment in question involved combining [[nitrous oxide]] (NO) with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In one combination, these gases formed [[dinitrogen trioxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but when he repeated the combination with double the amount of oxygen (a ratio of 1:2), they instead formed [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

4NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

4NO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 4NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Atomic theory conflicted with the theory of [[infinite divisibility]], which states that [[matter]] can always be divided into smaller parts. In 1827, biologist [[Robert Brown]] observed that pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] theorised that this [[Brownian motion]] was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a mathematical theory around it. This theory was validated experimentally in 1911 by French physicist [[Jean Perrin]].

===Discovery of subatomic particles===

For much of this time, atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter. However, in 1897, [[J.J. Thomson]] published his work proving that [[cathode ray]]s are made of negatively charged particles ([[electron]]s). Since cathode rays are emitted from matter, this proved that atoms are made up of [[subatomic particles]] and are therefore divisible, and not the indivisible ''atomos'' postulated by [[Democritus]]. Physicists later invented a new term for such indivisible units, &quot;[[elementary particle]]s&quot;, since the word atom had come into its common modern use.

===Study of atomic structure===

At first, it was believed that the electrons were distributed more or less uniformly in a sea of positive charge (the [[plum pudding model]]). However, an experiment conducted in 1909 by colleagues of [[Ernest Rutherford]] demonstrated that atoms have a most of their mass and positive charge concentrated in a [[nucleus]]. In the [[gold foil experiment]], [[alpha particle]]s (emitted by [[polonium]]) were shot through a sheet of [[gold]]. Rutherford observed that most of the particles passed straight through the sheet with little deflection (striking a [[fluorescence|fluorescent screen]] on the other side). About 1 in 8000 of the alpha particles, however, were heavily deflected (by more than 90 degrees). This led to the planetary model of the atom in which pointlike electrons orbited in the space around a massive compact nucleus like planets orbiting the Sun.

The nucleus was later discovered to contain [[proton]]s, and further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms surpassed that of the protons it possessed; this led him to postulate the existence of [[neutron]]s, whose existence would be proven in 1932 by [[James Chadwick]].

The planetary model of the atom still had shortcomings. Firstly, a moving [[electric charge]] emits [[electromagnetic wave]]s; according to [[classical electromagnetism]], an orbiting charge would steadily lose energy and spiral towards the nucleus, colliding with it in a tiny fraction of a second. Secondly, the model did not explain why excited atoms emit light only in certain [[emission spectrum|discrete spectra]].  

[[Quantum theory]] revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century when [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in fixed amounts known as [[quanta]]. In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] used this idea in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom, in which the electrons could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed [[angular momentum]] and energy. They were not allowed to spiral into the nucleus, because they could not lose energy in a continuous manner; they could only make [[quantum leap]]s between fixed [[energy level]]s. Bohr's model was extended by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in 1916 to include elliptical orbits, using a quantization of [[generalized momentum]].

The ad hoc Bohr-Sommerfeld model was extremely difficult to use, but it made impressive predictions in agreement with certain spectral properties. However, the model was unable to explain multielectron atoms, predict [[transition rate]]s or describe [[fine structure|fine]] and [[hyperfine structure]]. In 1925, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed a full theory of quantum mechanics, described by the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Together with [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]], this allowed study of atoms with great precision when digital computers became available. Even today, these theories are used in the [[Hartree-Fock]] [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] method to determine the energy levels of atoms. Further refinements of quantum theory such as the [[Dirac equation]] and [[quantum field theory]] made smaller impacts on the theory of atoms.

Another model of historical interest, proposed by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916, had [[cubical atom]]s with electrons statically held at the corners. The cubes could share edges or faces to form chemical bonds. This model was created to account for chemical phenomena such as bonding, rather than physical phenomena such as atomic spectra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:040719_172_dorset_marnhull.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern arable agriculture typically uses large [[field (agriculture)|fields]] like this one in [[Dorset]], [[England]].]]
In [[geography]], '''arable land''' (from [[Latin]] ''arare'', to [[plough]] ) is a form of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[land use]], meaning [[land (economics)|land]] that can be (and is) used for growing [[agriculture|crops]].  [[David Ricardo]] incorporated the idea of arable land into [[economic]] [[theory]].

Of the earth's 57 million square miles (148,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) of land, more than 12 million square miles (31,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2;) are arable. 

Most of the arable land on earth is around the largest rivers on earth. Some examples are: the [[Nile]] River, the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers, the [[Yellow River]], the [[Amazon River]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Rhine]] River. These rivers flood regularly, overspilling their banks. When the flood is over, the rivers recede, leaving behind rich [[silt]]. This silt is excellent fertilizer for [[crops]]. Even if the land is overfarmed, and all the [[nutrient]]s are depleted from the soil, the land renews its fertility when the next flood comes. Rivers and streams can make desert land arable. 

==Unarable land==

On unarable land, farming is nearly impossible unless more advanced methods of [[agriculture]] are used. Unarable land usually has no source of fresh water, and is often too hot (desert), too cold (arctic), too rocky, too mountainous, too salty, too rainy, too snowy, or too cloudy. Clouds block the sunlight plants need for [[photosynthesis]] (making sunlight into food). The plants starve without light. [[Starvation]] and [[nomad]]ism often exist on unarable land. Unarable land is sometimes called 'wastes', 'badlands', 'worthless' or 'no man's land'.

Sometimes, unarable land can be turned into arable land. New arable land makes more food, and can prevent [[starvation]], saving lives. This also makes the country more [[self-sufficient]] and politically independent, because the country doesn't have to buy food from other countries. Making unarable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells, aquaducts, [[desalination]] plants, planting trees for shade in the desert, [[hydroponic]]s, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, [[pesticide]]s, [[reverse osmosis]] water processors, [[mylar]] insulation or other insulation against heat and cold, digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind, and greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas.

Some examples of infertile '''unarable''' land being turned into fertile '''arable''' land are: 
* Aran Island: This island off the west coast of Ireland, (not to be confused with the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]]'s [[Firth of Clyde]]), was unarable because it was too rocky. The people covered the island with a shallow layer of seaweed and sand from the ocean. This made it arable. Today, they grow crops there.
* [[Israel]]: Israel was mostly unarable desert until [[desalination]] plants were built on the coast. The plants turn salt water into fresh water for farming, drinking, and washing. They created their own large fresh water source.

Some examples of fertile '''arable''' land being turned into infertile '''unarable''' land are: 
* Droughts like the '[[dust bowl]]' of the [[Great Depression]] in the U.S. turned farmland into desert. 
* [[Rainforest]] Deforestation: The fertile tropical forests turn into infertile desert land.
* [[Roman Republic|Roman]]s' destruction of [[Carthage]]: At the end of the [[Punic War]]s, the victorious Romans sowed the earth with salt, to symbolize total victory. The Roman symbol meant that Carthage would never grow back - their civilization ended. Crops won't generally grow in salty soil. This is why salt water from the ocean can't be used to water crops. 
* Each year more arable land is lost to desertification and [[erosion]] from human industrial activities. Irrigation of farm land also increases the [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] in the soil. This process steadily concentrates salt in the ground, decreasing productivity for crops that are not salt-tolerant.
* [[Urban sprawl]]: In the United States, about 2.2 million acres (8,900 km²) of land was added to urban areas between 1992 and 2002, much of it farm land now paved.

'''Aluminium''' or '''aluminum''' (see the [[#Spelling|spelling]] section below) is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol '''Al''' and atomic number 13.  It is a silvery and ductile member of the [[poor metal]] group of [[chemical element]]s. Aluminium is found primarily as the ore [[bauxite]] and is remarkable for its resistance to corrosion (due to the phenomenon of [[passivation]]) and its light weight. Aluminium is used in many industries to make millions of different products and is very important to the [[world economy]]. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and very important in other areas of [[transport]]ation and building in which light weight, durability, and strength are needed.

==Properties==
[[Image:Aluminum_Metal.jpg|thumb|left|A piece of aluminium metal about 15 centimetres long.]]
Aluminium is a soft and lightweight metal with a dull silvery appearance, due to a thin layer of [[oxidation]] that forms quickly when it is exposed to air. Aluminium is nontoxic (as the metal), non-magnetic, and non-sparking. Pure aluminium has a tensile strength of about 49 megapascals (MPa) and 400 MPa if it is formed into an alloy. Aluminium is about one-third as dense as [[steel]] or [[copper]]; is [[Malleability|malleable]], [[Ductility|ductile]], and easily machined and cast; and has excellent [[corrosion]] resistance and durability due to the protective oxide layer. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200-400 nm (UV) , and the 3000-10000 nm (far IR) regions, while in the 400-700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by [[silver]], and in the 700-3000 (near IR) by silver, [[gold]] and copper. It is the second most malleable metal (after gold) and the sixth most [[ductile]]. Aluminium is a good heat [[conductor]] which is why it is used to make saucepans.
[[Image:Bohr2.gif|thumb|Caption|[[Bohr]] Diagram.]]

==Applications==
Whether measured in terms of quantity or value, the use of aluminium exceeds that of any other metal except [[iron]], and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy.

Pure aluminium has a low [[tensile strength]], but readily forms [[alloy]]s with many elements such as copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese and silicon (e.g.[[duralumin]]). Today almost all materials that claim to be aluminium are actually an alloy thereof. Pure aluminium is encountered only when corrosion resistance is more important than strength or hardness. Conversely, the term &quot;alloy&quot; in general use today usually means aluminium alloy.

When combined with thermo-mechanical processing aluminium [[alloy]]s display a marked improvement in mechanical properties. Aluminium alloys form vital components of [[aircraft]] and [[rocket]]s as a result of their high strength to weight ratio. 

When aluminium is evaporated in a [[vacuum]] it forms a coating that reflects both [[visible light]] and [[infrared]]. These coatings form a thin layer of protective aluminium oxide that does not deteriorate as [[silver]] coatings do. In particular, nearly all modern [[mirror]]s are made using a thin reflective coating of aluminium on the back surface of a sheet of [[float glass]]. [[Telescope]] mirrors are also coated with a thin layer of aluminium, but are front coated to avoid internal reflections even though this makes the surface more susceptible to damage.


[[Image:Diet Coke.jpg|thumb|150px|left|An [[aluminium can]] used for the [[soft drink]] [[Diet Coke]].]]
Some of the many uses for aluminium are in:
*Transportation ([[automobile]]s, [[airplane]]s, [[truck]]s, [[railroad car]]s, marine vessels, [[bicycle]]s etc.)
*Packaging ([[aluminum can|cans]], [[aluminium foil|foil]], etc.)
*Water treatment
*Construction ([[window]]s, [[door]]s, siding, building wire, etc.
*Consumer durable goods (appliances, [[cooking utensil]]s, etc.)
*[[electricity|Electrical]] [[transmission lines]] (aluminium components and wires are less dense than those made of copper and are lower in price [http://www.metalprices.com], but also present higher electrical resistance.  Many localities prohibit the use of aluminum in residential wiring practices because of its higher resistance and thermal expansion value.)
*Machinery
*[[MKM steel]] and [[Alnico]] magnets, although non-[[magnet]]ic itself
*Super purity aluminium (SPA, 99.980% to 99.999% Al), used in electronics and [[compact disc|CD]]s.
*[[Powder]]ed aluminium, a commonly used [[silvering]] agent in [[paint]]. Aluminium flakes may also be included in undercoat paints, particularly wood [[primer (paint)|primer]] &amp;mdash; on drying, the flakes overlap to produce a water resistant barrier.
*[[Anodising|Anodised]] aluminium is more stable to further oxidation, and is used in various fields of construction, as well as [[heat sink]]ing.
*Most electronic appliances that require cooling of their internal devices (like transistors, [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s - semiconductors in general) have [[heat sink]]s that are made of aluminium due to its ease of manufacture and good heat conductivity. [[Copper]] heat sinks are smaller although more expensive and harder to manufacture.

*Aluminium oxide, [[alumina]], is found naturally as [[corundum]] ([[ruby|rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s), [[emery (mineral)|emery]], and is used in [[glass]] making. Synthetic ruby and sapphire are used in [[laser]]s for the production of [[coherent light]].

*Aluminium oxidises very energetically and as a result has found use in [[solid rocket]] fuels, [[thermite]], and other [[pyrotechnic]] compositions.

Aluminium is also a [[superconductor]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[kelvin]]s.

===Engineering use===
Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[ISO]]). Selecting the right alloy for a given application entails considerations of strength, [[ductility]], formability, [[weldability]] and [[corrosion]] resistance to name a few. A brief historical overview of alloys and manufacturing technologies is given in Ref. &lt;ref name=sanders&gt;R.E. Sanders, Technology Innovation in Aluminum Products, ''The Journal of The Minerals'', 53(2):21-25, 2001. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0102/Sanders-0102.html Online ed.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Improper use of aluminium can result in problems, particularly in contrast to [[iron]] or [[steel]], which appear &quot;better behaved&quot; to the intuitive designer, mechanic, or technician. The reduction by two thirds of the weight of an aluminium part compared to a similarly sized iron or steel part seems enormously attractive, but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a reduction by two thirds in the stiffness of the part. Therefore, although direct replacement of an iron or steel part with a duplicate made from aluminium may still give acceptable strength to withstand peak loads, the increased flexibility will cause three times more deflection in the part. 

Where failure is not an issue but excessive flex is undesirable due to requirements for precision of location or efficiency of transmission of power, simple replacement of steel tubing with similarly sized aluminium tubing will result in a degree of flex which is undesirable; for instance, the increased flex under operating loads caused by replacing steel bicycle frame tubing with aluminium tubing of identical dimensions will cause misalignment of the power-train as well as absorbing the operating force. To increase the rigidity by increasing the thickness of the walls of the tubing increases the weight proportionately, so that the advantages of lighter weight are lost as the rigidity is restored. 

Aluminium can best be used by redesigning the part to suit its characteristics; for instance making a bicycle of aluminium tubing which has an oversize diameter rather than thicker walls. In this way, rigidity can be restored or even enhanced without increasing weight. The limit to this process is the increase in susceptibility to what is termed &quot;[[buckling]]&quot; failure, where the deviation of the force from any direction other than directly along the axis of the tubing causes folding of the walls of the tubing. 

The latest models of the [[Corvette]] automobile, among others, are a good example of redesigning parts to make best use of aluminium's advantages. The aluminium chassis members and suspension parts of these cars have large overall dimensions for stiffness but are lightened by reducing cross-sectional area and removing unneeded metal; as a result, they are not only equally or more durable and stiff as the usual steel parts, but they possess an airy gracefulness which most people find attractive. Similarly, aluminium bicycle frames can be optimally designed so as to provide rigidity where required, yet have flexibility in terms of absorbing the shock of bumps from the road and not transmitting them to the rider.

The strength and durability of aluminium varies widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of the particular manufacturing process; for this reason, it has from time to time gained a bad reputation. For instance, a high frequency of failure in many early aluminium bicycle frames in the [[1970]]s resulted in just such a poor reputation; with a moment's reflection, however, the widespread use of aluminium components in the [[aerospace]] and automotive high performance industries, where huge stresses are undergone with vanishingly small failure rates, proves that properly built aluminium bicycle components should not be unusually unreliable, and this has subsequently proved to be the case. 

Similarly, use of aluminium in automotive applications, particularly in engine parts which must survive in difficult conditions, has benefited from development over time. An [[Audi]] engineer commented about the V12 engine, producing over 500 horsepower (370 kW), of an [[Auto Union#The Auto Union racing cars |Auto Union race car]] of the [[1930s]] which was recently restored by the Audi factory, that the aluminium alloy of which the engine was constructed would today be used only for lawn furniture and the like. Even the aluminium [[cylinder head]]s and [[crankcase]] of the [[Corvair]], built as recently as the [[1960s]], earned a reputation for failure and stripping of [[thread]]s in holes, even as large as [[spark plug]] holes, which is not seen in current aluminium cylinder heads.

Often, aluminium's sensitivity to heat must also be considered. Even a relatively routine workshop procedure involving heating is complicated by the fact that aluminium, as opposed to steels, will melt without first turning red. Forming operations where a [[blow torch]] is used therefore requires some expertise since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting.  Aluminium also will accumulate internal stresses and strains under conditions of overheating; while not immediately obvious, the tendency of the metal to &quot;creep&quot; under sustained stresses results in delayed distortions, for instance the commonly observed warping or cracking of aluminium automobile cylinder heads after an engine is overheated, sometimes as long as years later, or the tendency of welded aluminium bicycle frames to gradually twist out of alignment from the stresses accumulated during the welding process. For this reason, many uses of aluminium in the aerospace industry avoid heat altogether by joining parts using [[adhesive]]s; this was also used for some of the early aluminium bicycle frames in the 1970s, with unfortunate results when the aluminium tubing corroded slightly, loosening the bond of the adhesive and leading to failure of the frame. Stresses from overheating aluminium can be relieved by heat-treating the parts in an oven and gradually cooling, in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses; this can also result, however, in the part becoming distorted as a result of these stresses, so that such heat-treating of welded bicycle frames, for instance, results in a significant fraction becoming misaligned. If the misalignment is not too severe, once cooled they can be bent back into alignment with no negative consequences; of course, if the frame is properly designed for rigidity (see above), this will require enormous force. 

====Household wiring====
Because of its high conductivity and relatively low price compared to [[copper]] at the time, aluminium was introduced for household electrical wiring to a large degree in the United States in the 1960s. Unfortunately, many of the wiring fixtures at the time were not designed to accept aluminium wire. More specifically:

* The greater [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of aluminium, causes the wire to expand and contract relative to the dissimilar metal [[screw]] connection, eventually loosening the connection.  

* Pure aluminium has a tendency to &quot;creep&quot; under steady sustained pressure (to a greater degree as the temperature rises), again producing a degree of looseness in an initially tight connection.

* [[Galvanic cell#Galvanic corrosion|Galvanic corrosion]] from the dissimilar metals increases the electrical resistance of the connection. 

In combination, these properties caused connections between electrical fixtures and aluminium wiring to overheat which resulted in several fires. As a result, aluminium household wiring has become unpopular, and in many jurisdictions it is not permitted in very small sizes in new construction. However, aluminium wiring can be safely used with fixtures whose connections are designed to avoid loosening and overheating. Older fixtures of this type are marked &quot;Al/Cu&quot;, and newer ones are marked &quot;CO/ALR&quot;.  Otherwise, aluminium wiring can be terminated by [[crimp (metalworking)|crimping]] it to a short &quot;[[pigtail]]&quot; of copper wire, which can be treated as any other copper wire. A properly done crimp, requiring high pressure produced by the proper tool, is tight enough not only to eliminate any thermal expansion of the aluminium, but also to exclude any atmospheric oxygen and thus prevent corrosion between dissimilar metals. New alloys are used for aluminium building wire today in combination with aluminium terminations. Connections made with these standard industry products are as safe and reliable as copper connections.

==History==
The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used salts of this metal as dyeing [[mordant]]s and as astringents for dressing wounds, and [[alum]] is still used as a [[styptic]]. Further [[Joseph Needham]] suggested finds in 1974 showed the ancient Chinese used aluminium (''see &quot;notes&quot; linked above''). In 1761 [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the base alum 'alumine'. In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he named (''see [[#Spelling|Spelling]] section'').

[[Friedrich Woehler|Friedrich Wöhler]] is generally credited with isolating aluminium ([[Latin]] ''alumen'', [[alum]]) in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium. However, the metal had been produced for the first time two years earlier in an impure form by the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. Therefore almanacs and chemistry sites often list Ørsted as the discoverer of aluminium.[http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/al.html#isotopes] Still it would further be P. Berthier who discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it. The Frenchman [[Henri Saint-Claire Deville]] improved Wöhler's method in 1846 and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium.

The American [[Charles Martin Hall]] of [[Oberlin, OH]] applied for a [[patent]] (400655) in 1886 for an electrolytic process to extract aluminium using the same technique that was independently being developed by the Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] in Europe. The invention of the [[Hall-Heroult process|Hall-Héroult process]] in 1886 made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper, and is now the principal method in common use throughout the world. The Hall-Heroult process cannot produce Super Purity Aluminium directly. Upon approval of his patent in 1889, Hall, with the financial backing of [[Alfred E. Hunt]] of [[Pittsburgh, PA]], started the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, renamed to Aluminum Company of America in 1907, later shortened to [[Alcoa]].

[[Image:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue known as ''Eros'' in [[Piccadilly Circus]] London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium.]] Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the [[Washington Monument]], at a time when one [[ounce]] cost twice the daily wages of a common worker in the project. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9511/Binczewski-9511.html]

Germany became the world leader in aluminium production soon after [[Adolf Hitler]] seized power. By 1942, however, new hydroelectric power projects such as the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] gave the United States something Nazi Germany could not hope to compete with, namely the capability of producing enough aluminium to manufacture sixty thousand warplanes in four years. [http://www.phpsolvent.com/wordpress/?page_id=341]

==Natural occurrence==
Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in Earth's crust (believed to be 7.5% to 8.1%), it is very rare in its free form and was once considered a [[precious metal]] more valuable than [[gold]]. [[Napoleon III of France]] had a set of aluminium plates reserved for his finest guests. Others had to make do with gold ones. Aluminium has been produced in commercial quantities for just over 100 years.

Aluminium was, when it was first discovered, extremely difficult to separate from its ore. Aluminium is among the most difficult metals on Earth to refine, despite the fact that it is one of the planet's most common. The reason is that aluminium is oxidised very rapidly and that its oxide is an extremely stable compound that, unlike rust on iron, does not flake off. The very reason for which aluminium is used in many applications is why it is so hard to produce.

Recovery of this metal from scrap (via [[recycling]]) has become an important component of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves simply melting the metal, which is far less expensive than creating it from ore. Refining aluminium requires enormous amounts of [[electricity]]; recycling it requires only 5% of the energy to produce it. A common practice since the early [[20th century|1900s]], aluminium recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when the exploding popularity of aluminium [[beverage can]]s finally placed recycling into the public consciousness. Other sources for recycled aluminium include automobile parts, windows and doors, appliances, containers and other products.

Aluminium is a reactive metal and it is hard to extract it from its ore, [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Direct reduction, with [[carbon]] for example, is not economically viable since aluminium oxide has a melting point of about 2000 °C. Therefore, it is extracted by [[electrolysis]] &amp;mdash; the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten [[cryolite]] and then reduced to the pure metal. By this process, the actual operational temperature of the reduction cells is around 950 to 980 °C. Cryolite was originally found as a mineral on Greenland, but has been replaced by a synthetic cryolite. Cryolite is a mixture of aluminium, [[sodium]], and [[calcium]] [[fluoride]]s: (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining [[bauxite]], which is red since it contains 30 to 40% iron oxide. This is done using the so-called [[Bayer process]]. Previously, the [[Deville process]] was the predominant refining technology. 

The electrolytic process replaced the [[Wöhler process]], which involved the reduction of anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]]. Both of the [[electrode]]s used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are [[carbon]]. Once the ore is in the molten state, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the negative [[cathode]] is
:Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; Al

Here the aluminium ion is being reduced (electrons are added). The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.

At the positive electrode ([[anode]]) oxygen gas is formed:
:2 O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

This carbon [[anode]] is then oxidised by the oxygen. The anodes in a reduction must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C &amp;rarr; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Contrary to the anodes, the cathodes are not consumed during the operation, since there is no oxygen present at the cathode. The carbon cathode is protected by the liquid aluminium inside the cells. Cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes. After 5 to 10 years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be reconstructed completely, because the cathodes are completely worn.

Aluminium [[electrolysis]] with the [[Hall-Héroult]] process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The world-wide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). The most modern smelters reach approximately 12.8 kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). Reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA. State-of-the-art smelters operate with about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.

Electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the aluminium smelter. Smelters tend to be located where electric power is plentiful and inexpensive, such as [[South Africa]], the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Middle-East]], [[Russia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]].

In 2004, [[China]] was the top world producer of aluminium. [[Suriname]] depends on aluminium exports for 70% of its export earnings.[http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ns.html#Econ]
; see also [[:category:Aluminium minerals]]

==Isotopes==
Aluminium has nine [[isotope]]s, whose mass numbers range from 23 to 30. Only &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[stable isotope]]) and &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al ([[radioactive_decay|radioactive]] isotope, [[half life|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 7.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[year|y]]) occur naturally, however &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al has a natural abundance of 100%.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, [[manganese]] nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al to &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; year time scales.

[[Cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was first applied in studies of the [[Moon]] and meteorites. Meteorite fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding protects the meteorite fragments from further &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Possibly, the energy released by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was responsible for the remelting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.6 billion years ago.

===Clusters===
In the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' of [[14 January]] [[2005]] it was reported that clusters of 13 aluminium atoms (Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;) had been made to behave like an [[iodine]] atom; and, 14 aluminium atoms (Al&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;) behaved like an [[alkaline earth]] atom. The researchers also bound 12 iodine atoms to an Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; cluster to form a new class of polyiodide. This discovery is reported to give rise to the possibility of a new characterisation of the [[periodic table]]: [[superatom]]s. The research teams were led by Shiv N. Khanna ([[Virginia Commonwealth University]]) and A. Welford Castleman Jr ([[Penn State University]]). [http://www.science.psu.edu/alert/Castleman1-2005.htm]

==Precautions==
Aluminium is one of the few abundant elements that appears to have no beneficial function in living cells, but a few percent of people are allergic to it &amp;mdash; they experience [[contact dermatitis]] from any form of it: an itchy [[rash]] from using [[styptic]] or antiperspirant products, digestive disorders and inability to absorb nutrients from eating food cooked in aluminium pans, and vomiting and other symptoms of poisoning from ingesting such products as [[Rolaids]] , Amphojel, and [[Maalox]] ([[antacid]]s). In other people, aluminium is not considered as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts, although the use of aluminium cookware, popular because of its corrosion resistance and good [[heat conduction]], has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general. Excessive consumption of [[antacid]]s containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing [[antiperspirant]]s are more likely causes of [[toxicity]]. It has been suggested that aluminium may be linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]], although that research has recently been refuted; aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the Alzheimer's damage, not the cause. In any event, if there is any toxicity of aluminium it must be via a very specific mechanism, since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime.

Care must be taken to prevent aluminium from coming into contact with certain chemicals that can cause it to [[corrode]] quickly. For example, just a small amount of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] applied to the surface of a piece of aluminium can break up the aluminium oxide barrier usually present. Within a few hours, even a heavy structural beam can be significantly weakened. For this reason, mercury [[thermometer]]s are not allowed on many [[airliner]]s, as aluminium is a common structural component in aircraft.

==Spelling==
===Etymology/Nomenclature history===
In [[1808]], [[Humphry Davy]] originally proposed the name ''alumium'' while trying to isolate the new metal electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. In [[1812]] he changed the name to ''aluminum'' to match its [[Latin]] root. The same year, an anonymous contributor to the ''Quarterly Review'' objected to ''aluminum'', and proposed the name ''aluminium''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aluminium, for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound. (Q. Review VIII. 72, 1812)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This had the advantage of conforming to the -ium suffix precedent set by other newly discovered elements of the period: [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy had isolated himself). Nevertheless, -um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time: [[platinum]], which had been known to Europeans since the 16th century, [[molybdenum]], which was discovered in 1778, and [[tantalum]], which was discovered in 1802, all have spellings ending in -um. 

The United States adopted the -ium for most of the [[19th century]] with ''aluminium'' appearing in [[Noah Webster|Webster]]'s Dictionary of 1828. However in 1892 [[Charles Martin Hall]] used the -um spelling in an advertising handbill for his new efficient electrolytic method for the production of aluminium, despite using the -ium spelling in all of his patents filed between 1886 and 1903. It has consequently been suggested that the spelling on the flyer was a simple spelling mistake rather than a deliberate choice to use the -um spelling. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling ''aluminum'' became the standard in North America, even though the ''Webster Unabridged Dictionary'' of 1913 continued to use the -ium version.

In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications, and American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as a British variant.

===Present-day spelling===
In the English-speaking world, the spellings (and associated pronunciations) ''aluminium'' and ''aluminum'' are both in common use in scientific and nonscientific contexts. In the United States, the spelling ''aluminium'' is largely unknown, and the spelling ''aluminum'' predominates. Elsewhere in the English-speaking world the spelling ''aluminium'' predominates, and the spelling ''aluminum'' is largely unknown. However, in Canada both spellings are common, due to the multiple influences on the language of its proximity to the United States, its British colonial past and the large number of native French speakers.

Outside English, the &quot;ium&quot; spelling is widespread: the word is ''aluminium'' in [[French language|French]], ''Aluminium'' in [[German language|German]], and identical or similar forms are used in many other languages. Consequently it is the more common of the two spellings in global terms, even though there may be more users of ''aluminum'' in the English-speaking world.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990, but three years later recognised ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both, but places aluminium first [http://www.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/index.html].  IUPAC officially prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications, although several IUPAC publications use the spelling ''aluminum.''[http://www.iupac.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?sort=score&amp;restrict=www.iupac.org%2Fpublications%2Fci&amp;config=htdig&amp;restrict=&amp;exclude=www.iupac.org%2Fgoldbook%2F&amp;words=aluminum&amp;submit=]

==Chemistry==
===Oxidation state 1===
*AlH is produced when aluminium is heated at 1500 °C in an atmosphere of [[hydrogen]].
*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[silicon]] at 1800 °C in a [[vacuum]].
*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S can be made by heating Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with aluminium shavings at 1300 °C in a vacuum. It quickly disproportionates to the starting materials. The selenide is made in a parallel manner.
*AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the tri-halide is heated with aluminium.

===Oxidation state 2===
*Aluminium suboxide, AlO can be shown to be present when aluminium powder burns in oxygen.

===Oxidation state 3===
*[[Fajans rules]] show that the simple trivalent cation Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is not expected to be found in anhydrous salts or binary compounds such as Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydroxide is a weak base and aluminium salts of weak bases, such as carbonate, can't be prepared. The salts of strong acids, such as nitrate, are stable and soluble in water, forming hydrates with at least six molecules of [[water of crystallization]].
*Aluminium hydride, (AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced from [[trimethylaluminium]] and an excess of hydrogen. It burns explosively in air. It can also be prepared by the action of [[aluminium chloride]] on lithium hydride in ether solution, but cannot be isolated free from the solvent.
*Aluminium carbide, Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1000 °C. The pale yellow crystals have a complex lattice structure, and react with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The acetylide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.
*Aluminium nitride, AlN, can be made from the elements at 800 °C. It is hydrolysed by water to form [[ammonia]] and aluminium hydroxide.
*Aluminium phosphide, AlP, is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]].
*Aluminium oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, occurs naturally as [[corundum]], and can be made by burning aluminium in oxygen or by heating the hydroxide, nitrate or sulfate. As a [[gemstone]], its hardness is only exceeded by [[diamond]], [[boron nitride]] and [[carborundum]]. It is almost insoluble in water.
*Aluminium hydroxide may be prepared as a gelatinous precipitate by adding ammonia to an aqueous solution of an aluminium salt. It is [[amphoteric]], being both a very weak acid, and forming aluminates with [[alkali]]s. It exists in various crystalline forms.
*Aluminium sulfide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, may be prepared by passing [[hydrogen sulfide]] over aluminium powder. It is [[polymorphic]].
*Aluminium fluoride, AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by treating the hydroxide with HF, or can be made from the elements. It consists of a giant molecule which sublimes without melting at 1291 °C. It is very inert. The other trihalides are dimeric, having a bridge-like structure.
*Organo-metallic compounds of empirical formula AlR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exist and, if not also giant molecules, are at least [[dimer]]s or trimers. They have some uses in [[organic synthesis]], for instance [[trimethylaluminium]].
*Alumino-hydrides of the most electropositive elements are known, the most useful being [[lithium aluminium hydride]], Li[AlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. It decomposes into lithium hydride, aluminium and hydrogen when heated, and is hydrolysed by water. It has many uses in organic chemistry, particularly as a reducing agent. The aluminohalides have a similar structure.

'''Abdication''' (from the [[Latin]] ''abdicatio'', disowning, renouncing, from ''ab'', from, and ''dicare'', to declare, to proclaim as not belonging to one) is the act of renouncing and resigning from a formal office, especially from the supreme office of [[state]].  (In [[Roman law]] the term was also applied to the disowning of a family member, as the disinheriting of a son.) A similar term for an elected or appointed official is [[resignation]].

==Abdications in Classical Antiquity==
Among the most memorable abdications of antiquity were those of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] the [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] in [[79 BC]], [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in [[305|AD 305]], and Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in [[476|AD 476]].

==The British Crown==
Probably the most famous abdication in recent memory is that of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] in [[1936]].  Edward abdicated the British throne in order to marry American divorcée [[Wallis Simpson]], over the objections of the British establishment, the governments of the [[Commonwealth]], the royal family and the [[Church of England]].  (''See'' [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII]].)  This was also the first time in history that the British crown was surrendered entirely voluntarily.  [[Richard II of England]], for example, was forced to abdicate after the throne was seized by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, while Richard was out of the country.

When [[James II of England]], after throwing the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] into the [[Thames]], fled to [[France]] in [[1688]], he did not formally resign the crown, and the question was discussed in Parliament whether he had forfeited the throne or had abdicated.  The latter designation was agreed upon, for in a full assembly of the Lords and Commons, met in convention, it was resolved in spite of James's protest &quot;''that King James II having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom, by breaking the original contract between king and people, and, by the advice of [[Jesuits]] and other wicked persons, having violated the fundamental laws, and having withdrawn himself out of this kingdom, has abdicated the government, and that the throne is thereby vacant.''&quot;  The [[Scottish parliament]] pronounced a decree of [[forfeiture]] and [[deposition]].  

Because the title to the Crown depends upon [[statute]], particularly the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], a Royal Abdication can only be effected by an [[Act of Parliament]]. To give legal effect to the abdication of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 was passed.

==Modern abdications==
Historically, if a monarch abdicated it was seen as a profound and shocking abandonment of royal duty. As a result, abdications usually only occurred in the most extreme circumstances of political turmoil or violence. This has changed in a small number of countries: the monarchs of the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Cambodia]] have abdicated as a result of old age. Prince [[Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein]] recently made his son [[regent]], an act which amounted to an abdication in fact if not in law.

==Notes==
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Charles abdicated as lord of the [[Netherlands]] ([[October 25]], [[1555]]) and king of [[Spain]] ([[January 16]], [[1556]]), in favor of his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. Also in 1556 he separately voluntarily abdicated his German possessions and the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Pedro IV of Portugal and Pedro I of Brazil were the same person. He was already Emperor of Brazil when he succeeded to the throne of Portugal in 1826, but abdicated it at once in favour of his daughter [[Maria II of Portugal]]. Later he abdicated the throne of Brazil in favor of his son [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Hans-Adam II made his son [[Alois of Liechtenstein|Alois]] regent, effectively abdicating; however, he still remains the formal Head of State.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CompassRose.gif|thumb|The Anglican Communion uses the [[compass rose]] as its symbol, signifying its worldwide reach and decentralized nature. It is surmounted, like ecclesiastical coats of arms, by a bishop's [[mitre]]; in the center is a [[St. George's cross | cross of St. George]] recalling the communion's origins in the [[Church of England]]. The [[Greek language | Greek]] motto, &amp;#7977; &amp;#7936;&amp;lambda;&amp;#942;&amp;theta;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha; &amp;#7952;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;&amp;upsilon;&amp;theta;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rho;&amp;#974;&amp;sigma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota; &amp;#8017;&amp;mu;&amp;#8118;&amp;sigmaf; (&quot;The truth will set you free&quot;) is a quotation from [[Gospel of John|John]] 8:32.]]

The '''Anglican Communion''' is a world-wide organisation of [[Anglican]] Churches. There is no single &quot;Anglican Church&quot; since each national or regional church has full autonomy; as the name suggests, rather, the Anglican ''Communion'' is an association of these churches in [[full communion]] with each other and particularly with the [[Church of England]], which may be regarded as the &quot;mother church&quot; of the worldwide communion. 

As a result, all [[rite]]s conducted in one member church are recognised by the others.  Some of these churches are known as Anglican, explicitly recognising the link to England; others, such as the American and Scottish [[Episcopal Church| Episcopal]] churches, or the [[Church of Ireland]], prefer a specific name. Each church has its own [[doctrine]] and [[liturgy]], based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall episcopal leadership from a local [[primate (religion) | primate]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that country; but is recognised as a symbolic head for the worldwide communion. Among the other primates, he is ''primus inter pares'', or &quot;[[first among equals]].&quot; If the Archbishop of Canterbury is compared with other religious leaders such as the [[Pope]], therefore, it is only because of his prominent figurehead role in the media. He has no formal authority outside his own province.

Although they are not considered members, some non-Anglican bodies have entered into communion with the Anglican Communion despite having non-Anglican origins and traditions. There are also a number of Anglican-type bodies which separated from a member church of the Anglican Communion and thus are no longer in communion with the Church of England. They tend to call themselves &quot;[[Anglican continuing churches|continuing churches]].&quot;

==What holds the Communion together?==
{{Anglicanism}}
The Anglican Communion has no official legal existence nor any formal governing structure. (There is an &quot;[[Anglican Communion Office]]&quot; in London, under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury; but it serves merely a supporting and organisational role.) Some have asked what holds the communion together.

The first attempt at an answer was the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of [[1888]]. Proposed by the American Episcopal Church in 1886 and adopted by the [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1888, it set out four principles for future Christian unity. Although wider union has not followed, the quadrilateral has been useful within the communion itself.

The quadrilateral, according to the wording adopted in Lambeth ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/Chicago_Lambeth.html]), consists of:

# &quot;The Holy Scriptures of the [[Old Testament | Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, as 'containing all things necessary to salvation', and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.&quot;
# &quot;The [[Apostles' Creed]], as the Baptismal Symbol; and the [[Nicene Creed]], as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.&quot;
# &quot;The two [[Sacrament]]s ordained by Christ Himself - Baptism and the Supper of the Lord - ministered with unfailing use of Christ's words of Institution, and of the elements ordained by Him.&quot;
# &quot;The Historic [[bishop|Episcopate]], locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.&quot;

This, then, is the theoretical basis for unity. But what holds it together organisationally? In the last few years people have began to refer to four &quot;Instruments of Unity&quot;, which are effectively symbols to which all the churches of the communion can feel tied. In order of antiquity, they are:

* The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (''ab origine'')
* The [[Lambeth Conference]] (first held in [[1867]])
* The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] (first met in [[1971]])
* The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting | Primates' Meeting]] (first met in [[1979]])

Since each province is legally independent and free to chart its own course, the stress on these instruments of unity can easily be imagined. In recent years, for example, some Anglicans (particularly in Africa and Asia) have been displeased with the American and Canadian branches, upset by their welcoming attitudes towards homosexuals, and by the confident way the changes have been made &amp;mdash; the conservatives condemned the action as unilateral and called for wider consultation within the communion before such steps were taken. After the North American churches reaffirmed their belief that their actions had been righteous and &quot;prophetic&quot;, they were asked to withdraw their delegates from the 2005 meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council, although it is not clear under whose authority or by what law. They were eventually permitted at the meeting with voice, but no vote. They have not been expelled or suspended from the ''communion''; indeed, no church ever has. It is unclear how such an expulsion could ever be carried out, since the communion is not a disciplinary entity but a spiritual construct based entirely on the New Testament concept of [[koinonia]].

==Provinces of the Anglican Communion==
The term &quot;province&quot; in this context refers to national churches, many of which themselves contain several provinces in the sense of groups of dioceses presided over by an archbishop. According to the Secretariat of the Anglican Communion, currently the member churches of the Anglican Communion are as follows: 

*The [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]]

==History==

''Main article: see [[History of the Anglican Communion]]''

The Anglican Communion is a relatively recent concept. Ever since the [[Church of England]] (which until the [[20th century]] included the [[Church in Wales]]) broke from [[Roman Catholic Church | Rome]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England | Henry VIII]], it has thought of itself not as a new foundation but rather as a reformed continuation of the ancient &quot;English church&quot; and a reassertion of that church's rights. As such it was a distinctly local phenomenon. 

Thus the only members of the present Anglican Communion existing by the late 18th century were the Church of England, its closely-linked sister church, the [[Church of Ireland]] (which also broke from Rome under Henry VIII), and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which for parts of the [[17th century | 17th]] and [[18th century | 18th centuries]] was partially underground (it was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies).

However, the enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the [[British Empire]] brought the church along with it. At first all these colonial churches were under the jurisdiction of the [[Bishop of London]]. After the [[American Revolution]], the parishes in the newly independent country found it necessary to break formally from a church whose earthly head was (and remains) the [[British monarchy | British monarch]]. Thus they formed their own dioceses and national church, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], in a mostly amicable separation.

At about the same time, in the colonies which remained linked to the crown, the Church of England began to appoint colonial bishops. In 1787 a bishop of [[Nova Scotia]] was appointed with a jurisdiction over all of British North America; in time several more colleagues were appointed to other cities in present-day [[Canada]]. In [[1814]] a bishop of [[Calcutta]] was made; in [[1824]] the first bishop was sent to the [[West Indies]] and in [[1836]] to [[Australia]]. By 1840 there were still only ten colonial bishops for the Church of England; but even this small beginning greatly facilitated the growth of Anglicanism around the world. In [[1841]] a &quot;Colonial Bishoprics Council&quot; was set up and soon many more dioceses were created.

In time, it became natural to group these into provinces, and a [[metropolitan bishop | metropolitan]] appointed for each province. Although it had at first been somewhat established in many colonies, in [[1861]] it was ruled that, except where specifically established, the Church of England had just the same legal position as any other church. Thus a colonial bishop and colonial diocese was by nature quite a different thing from their counterparts back home. In time bishops came to be appointed locally rather than from England, and eventually national synods began to pass ecclesiastical legislation independent of England.

A crucial step in the development of the modern communion was the idea of the [[Lambeth Conferences]]. In [[1867]], at the suggestion of the Canadian [[synod]], the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Charles Thomas Langley]], invited a great conference of bishops to meet with him at [[Lambeth Palace]]. By inviting the bishops of the Churches of England and Ireland, those of the semi-autonomous colonial churches, and those of the fully autonomous [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], he set a precedent that they all could meet together despite the absence of universal legal ties. Some bishops were initially reluctant to attend, fearing that the meeting would declare itself a council with power to legislate for the church; but it agreed to pass only advisory resolutions. These Lambeth Conferences have been held decennially since 1878 (the second such conference), and remain the most visible coming-together of the whole communion.

==Recent controversies==
Recent disagreements over homosexuality have strained the unity of the communion as well as its relationships with other Christian denominations; see [[Anglican views of homosexuality]].

==Relationship with the Roman Catholic Church==
Efforts have been underway at least since 1966 to effect a reconciliation with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], focusing on theological issues [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19660324_paul-vi-ramsey_en.html] and ways &quot;to further the convergence on authority in the Church. Without agreement in this area we shall not reach the full visible unity to which we are both committed.&quot; [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19961205_jp-ii-carey_en.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''archipelago''' is a [[landform]] which consists of a chain or cluster of [[island|islands]]. Archipelagoes usually occur in the open sea; less commonly a large [[land mass]] may neighbour them. Archipelagoes are often [[volcano|volcanic]], forming along [[ocean ridge]]s or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], but there are many other processes involved in their construction, including [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]].

The word comes from the [[Aegean Sea]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''&amp;#945;&amp;#961;&amp;#967;&amp;#953;&amp;#960;&amp;#941;&amp;#955;&amp;#945;&amp;#947;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Arcipelago''), which  literally means &quot;chief sea&quot;, from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''arkhi'' (leader) and ''pelagos'' ([[sea]]). The Aegean Sea is located between [[Greece]] in the west and [[Turkey]] in the east. In the Aegean, the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Dukes of the Archipelago]] ruled from [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]], [[1210]]&amp;ndash;[[1566]].

The [[Archipelago Exchange]] is a fully electronic [[stock exchange]] that agreed to merge with the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in April 2005 to form the for-profit NYSE Group.

'''Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle''' ([[May 22]] [[1859]] &amp;ndash; [[July 7]] [[1930]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] author most famously known for his stories about the [[Detective fiction|detective]] [[Sherlock Holmes]], which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of [[crime fiction]]. He was a prolific writer whose other works include [[science fiction]] stories, [[historical novel]]s, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction.

Conan was originally a [[middle name]] but he used it as part of his surname in his later years.

==Life==
Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in [[Edinburgh]] to [[Charles Altamont Doyle|Charles]] and Mary Doyle.  He was sent to the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] [[preparatory school]] Stonyhurst at the age of nine, and by the time he left the school in [[1875]] he rejected [[Christianity]] to become an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. From [[1876]] to [[1881]] he studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], including a period working in the town of [[Aston]] (now a district of [[Birmingham]]). Following his term at University he served as a ship's doctor on a voyage to the West [[Africa]]n coast, and then in [[1882]] he set up a practice in [[Plymouth]]. He achieved his doctorate in 1885. His medical practice was unsuccessful; while waiting for patients he began writing stories. His first literary experience came in ''Chambers's Edinburgh Journal'' before he was 20.

It was only after he subsequently moved his practice to [[Southsea]] that he began to indulge more extensively in literature. His first significant work was ''A Study in Scarlet'' which appeared in ''Beeton's Christmas Annual'' for [[1887]] and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes who was modelled after Doyle's former University professor, [[Joseph Bell]]. Interestingly, [[Rudyard Kipling]] congratulated Doyle on his success, asking &quot;Could this be my old friend, Dr. Joe?&quot;.  While living in Southsea he helped form [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth Football Club]] and played as the club's first [[goalkeeper]].

In [[1885]] he married Louise Hawkins, who suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and eventually died in [[1906]]. He married Jean Leckie in [[1907]], whom he had first met and fallen in love with in [[1897]] but had maintained a [[Platonic love|platonic relationship]] with her out of loyalty to his first wife. Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (Mary and Kingsley), and three with his second wife ([[Jean Conan Doyle|Jean]], Denis, and [[Adrian Conan Doyle|Adrian]]).

In [[1890]] Doyle studied the eye in [[Vienna]], and in [[1891]] moved to [[London]] to set up a practice as an [[Ophthalmology|oculist]]. This also gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: &quot;I think of slaying Holmes... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.&quot; In December 1893, he did so in order to dedicate more of his time to more &quot;important&quot; works (namely his historical novels), pitting Holmes against his arch-nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]]. They apparently plunged to their deaths together down a waterfall in the story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Public outcry led him to bring the character back&amp;mdash;Doyle returned to the story in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, with the ingenious explanation that only Moriarty had fallen, but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had arranged to be temporarily &quot;dead&quot; also. Holmes eventually appears in a total of 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four Doyle novels (he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors).

Following the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in [[South Africa]] at the turn of the 20th century and the condemnation from around the world over Britain's conduct, Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'' which justified Britain's role in the Boer war and was widely translated. Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted and appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of [[Surrey]] in [[1902]]. He also wrote the longer book ''The Great Boer War'' in [[1900]]. During the early years of the 20th century Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], once in Edinburgh and once in the Border Burghs, but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected.  
[[Image:conandoylestatue.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Conan Doyle statue in Crowborough]]Conan Doyle was involved in the campaign for the reform of the [[Congo Free State]], led by the journalist [[E. D. Morel]] and the diplomat [[Roger Casement]]. He wrote [[The Crime of the Congo]] in [[1909]], a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in Congo. He become acquainted with Morel and Casement, taking inspiration from them for two of the main characters of the novel [[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]] (1912). He broke with both when Morel (who was rather left-wing) became one of the leaders of the pacifist movement during the [[World War I|First World War]], and Casement committed treason against Britain out of conviction for his [[Ireland|Irish]] nationalist views.  Doyle tried, unsuccessfully, to save Casement from the death penalty, arguing that he had been driven mad and was not responsible for his actions.

Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice, and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two imprisoned men being released.  The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]], who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were dead set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed. It was partially as a result of this case that the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] was established in [[1907]], so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped to establish a way to correct other [[miscarriages of justice]]. The story of Conan Doyle and Edalji is told in fictional form in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 [[novel]], [[Arthur &amp; George]].

The second case&amp;mdash;that of [[Oscar Slater]], a German Jew and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in [[1908]]&amp;mdash;excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed. 

In his later years, Doyle became involved with [[Spiritualism]], to the extent that he wrote a [[Professor Challenger]] novel on the subject, ''The Land of Mist''. One of the odder aspects of this period of his life was his book ''The Coming of the Fairies'' ([[1921]]). He was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs, which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, [[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]], was banned in the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1929]] for supposed [[occult]]ism. This ban was later removed.

Doyle was friends for a time with the American magician [[Harry Houdini]], a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist movement. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently attempted to expose them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers, a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.  Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply magic tricks, leading to a bitter, public falling out between the two.

[[Richard Milner]], an [[United States|American]] historian of science, has presented a case that Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the [[Piltdown man]] hoax of [[1912]], creating the counterfeit [[hominid]] [[fossil]] that fooled the scientific world for over 40 years. Milner says that Doyle had a motive, namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics, and that ''The Lost World'' contains several encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax. [http://www.arts.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml;jsessionid=JXWTHVY1DHO5NQFIQMGSNAGAVCBQWJVC?html=/archive/1997/03/20/npil20.html]

[[Samuel Rosenberg]]'s [[1974]] book ''[[Naked is the Best Disguise]]'' purports to explain how Doyle left, throughout his writings, open clues that related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died of a [[heart attack]] in [[1930]] and is buried in the Church Yard at [[Minstead]] in the [[New Forest]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].

A statue has been erected in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's honour. It may be seen at Crowborough Cross in [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], where Sir Arthur lived for 23 years. There is also a statue of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]] in Picardy Place, [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] - close to the house where Conan Doyle was born.

An '''author''' is the person who creates a written work, such as a [[book]], story, article or the like. This can be short or long, fiction or nonfiction, [[poetry]] or prose, technical or [[literature]]. Since [[capitalism]], the '''author''' also needs to do it for [[payment]] (as a [[service]]).

==Role in critical theory==

One key issue in [[literary theory]] is the relationship between the meaning of a literary [[text]] and its author's conscious intent.

* The phrase &quot;[[death of the author|Death of the Author]]&quot; was popularized by [[Roland Barthes]] in his [[1968]] essay with the same name. It is used to convey the idea that [[Text|texts]] have meaning and an independent existence outside that intended by the author, depending on the context and reader.

* The death of the author is in self-conscious opposition to the [[New Criticism]], a literary critical movement popular in England and America in the first half of the 20th century. According to this movement, the author's intent is assumed to be quite clear to the author and it becomes the critic's task to understand this intent.

'''Andrey Andreyevich Markov''' (Андрей Андреевич Марков) ([[June 14]], [[1856]] [[N.S.]] - [[July 20]], [[1922]]) was a [[Russia|Russian]] [[mathematician]].

Markov was born in [[Ryazan]]. He studied at [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg University]] in [[1874]] under the tutelage of [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]]. In [[1886]], he became a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St. Petersburg Academy of Science]]. He is best known for his work on theory of [[stochastic process]]es. His research later became known as [[Markov chain]]s.

      <comment>Alumnus status is a RELATIONSHIP between the person and the school.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- So far we have a dictionary definition and a discussion of the correct use of the term --&gt;
An '''alumnus''' (masculine) or '''alumna''' (feminine) of a [[colleges and universities|college, university]], or school is a former student.  Informal equivalents are '''alum''' and '''alumn''' (with a silent &quot;n&quot;).  The term is often mistakenly thought of as synonymous with &quot;graduate.&quot; Alumni/ae [[reunion]]s are popular events at many institutions. They are usually organized by [[alumni association]]s and are often social occasions for [[fundraising]].

In [[Latin]], ''alumnus'' is the masculine singular form and ''alumna'' the feminine singular form. (The words are derived from the Latin verb ''alere'', &quot;to nourish,&quot; and literally mean &quot;nourished one&quot; or &quot;nursling.&quot;) Although these terms are recommended by leading [[English language|English-language]] [[dictionary|dictionaries]], their use can be limited because they are [[non-sexist language|gender-specific]]. The Latin plural is '''alumni''' for men and mixed groups and '''alumnae''' for women. The gender-neutral English term ''alum''/''alumn'', created by [[clipping#Linguistics|clipping]] the ending from ''alumnus'', is also used, along with its plural '''alums'''/'''alumns'''.

Recently, the definition of &quot;alum&quot; has expanded to include people who have &quot;[[matriculation|matriculated]] at&quot; or exited from any kind of organization or process. As such, one can potentially be a &quot;corporate alum&quot; of XYZ Company, or an alum of a military branch, [[non-profit organization]], or training process.  

Educational institutions tend to follow Latin usage: ''alumnus'' for males, ''alumna'' for females, and ''alumni'' for mixed groups. All-women colleges use ''alumna'' and ''alumnae''. Some institutions, such as [[Texas A&amp;M University]], do not refer to their graduates as &quot;alumni&quot; or even &quot;graduates,&quot; choosing to use the term ''former students''.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Australia]], the phrases '''old boy''' and '''old girl''' are traditionally used for former school pupils, and '''old member''' for former university students. Some private schools in [[Canada]], such as [[Upper Canada College]] and the [[Bishop Strachan School]] also use '''old boy''' and '''old girl'''. The term '''old student''' can nowadays refer to the graduates of either schools or universities. In Scotland, the term ''Former Pupil'' (FP) is also used, especially when referring to sports teams of a school.

{{emotion}}
'''''Angst''''' is a [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[North Germanic language|North Germanic]] word for [[fear]] or [[anxiety]]. It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of internal emotional strife.

A different but related meaning is attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] ([[1813]]&amp;ndash;[[1855]]). Kierkegaard used the word ''angst'' (Danish, meaning &quot;dread&quot;) to describe a profound and deep-seated [[spirituality|spiritual]] condition of insecurity and [[despair]] in the free [[human being]]. Where the animal is a slave to its God-given instincts but always confident in its own actions, Kierkegaard believed that the freedom given to mankind leaves the human in a constant fear of failing its responsibilities to [[God]]. Kierkegaard's concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for 20th-century [[existentialism]].

While Kierkegaard's feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to [[god (monotheism)|God]], in modern  use, angst is broadened to include general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self, one's principles, and others (possibly including God). Still, the angst in alternative music may be more accessible to most audiences than the esoteric tradition of [[existentialism]]. The term &quot;angst&quot; is now widely used with a negative and derisive connotation that mocks the expression of a common adolescent experience of malaise.

==Angst in contemporary music==
Angst, in contemporary connotative use, most often describes the intense frustration and other related emotions of [[teenager]]s and the mood of the music with which they identify. [[Punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[emo (music)|emo]], and virtually any [[Alternative Rock]] dramatically combining elements of discord, [[melancholy]] and excitement may be said to assert angst. There is an obvious connection to this music and the various subjugation of its proponent youth or racial or sociopolitical minority [[subculture]].

Angst was probably first discussed in relation to contemporary music in the mid to late 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s &quot;teen angst&quot; was expressed in music to a certain extent in the rise of &quot;punk&quot;, but the word &quot;angst&quot; is currently more associated with, and was probably first used in reference to, the grunge movement and the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].  Nirvana themselves seem to have been aware of this, as evidenced by the first line of [[Serve the Servants]] in which [[Kurt Cobain]] describes the success of writing songs dealing with the subject (''Teenage angst has paid off well | Now I'm bored and old...'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anxiety''' refers to a complex combination of negative emotions that includes [[fear]], apprehension and worry, and is often accompanied by physical sensations such as [[Palpitation| palpitations]], chest pain and/or shortness of breath. 

Anxiety is often described as having [[cognitive]], [[somatic]], [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al components (Seligman, Walker &amp; Rosenhan, 2001). The cognitive component entails expectation of a diffuse and uncertain danger. Somatically the body prepares the organism to deal with threat (known as an emergency reaction); [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]] are increased, sweating is increased, bloodflow to the major muscle groups is increased, and [[immune system|immune]] and [[Digestion|digestive]] system functions are inhibited. Externally, somatic signs of anxiety may include pale skin, sweating, trembling and [[Mydriasis|pupillary dilation]]. Emotionally, anxiety causes a sense of dread or panic, nausea and chills. Behaviorally, both voluntary and involuntary behaviors may arise directed at escaping or avoiding the source of anxiety. These behaviors are frequent and often maladaptive, being most extreme in [[anxiety disorder]]s. However, anxiety is not always pathological or maladaptive: it is a common emotion along with fear, anger, sadness and happiness, and it has a very important function in relation to survival. 

Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] is thought to underlie anxiety (Rosen &amp; Schulkin, 1998). When confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the amygdala (Zald &amp; Pardo, 1997; Zald, Hagen &amp; Pardo, 2002). In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors such as feeding on rotten food.  
 
A chronically recurring case of anxiety that has a serious effect on a person's life may be clinically diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. The most common are [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[phobia]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

==Diagnosis==

A good assessment is essential for the initial diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, preferably using a standardised interview or questionnaire procedure alongside expert evaluation and the views of the person themselves. There should be a medical examination in order to identify possible medical conditions that can cause the symptoms of anxiety. A family history of anxiety disorders is suggestive of the possibility of an anxiety disorder.

==Diagnosis using a blood test==

In 2005 a research team from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] developed a method for potentially detecting raised anxiety by performing a simple blood test. This is only an early unreplicated study of a possible screening tool. [http://www.isracast.com/tech_news/101005_tech.htm]

==Generalized anxiety disorder==
{{main|General anxiety disorder}}

Generalized anxiety disorder is a common chronic disorder that affects twice as many women as men and can lead to considerable impairment (Brawman-Mintzer &amp; Lydiard, 1996, 1997).  As the name implies, generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any particular object or situation. In other words it is unspecific or free-floating. People with this disorder feel afraid of something but are unable to articulate the specific fear. They fret constantly and have a hard time controlling their worries. Because of persistent muscle tension and autonomic fear reactions, they may develop headaches, heart palpitations, dizziness, and insomnia. These physical complaints, combined with the intense, long-term anxiety, make it difficult to cope with normal daily activities.

==Panic disorder==
{{main|Panic disorder}}

In panic disorder, a person suffers brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension that cause trembling and shaking, dizziness, and difficulty breathing.  One who is often plagued by sudden bouts of intense anxiety might be said to be afflicted by this disorder.  The American Psychiatric Association (2000) defines a panic attack as fear or discomfort that arises abruptly and peaks in 10 minutes or less. 

Although panic attacks sometimes seem to occur out of nowhere, they generally happen after frightening experiences, prolonged stress, or even exercise.  Many people who have panic attacks (especially their first one) think they are having a heart attack and often end up at the doctor or ER. Even if the tests all come back normal the person will still worry, with the physical manifestations of anxiety only reinforcing their fear that something is wrong with their body. Extreme awareness of every little thing that happens or changes with their body can make for a stressful time.

Normal changes in heartbeat, such as when climbing a flight of stairs will be noticed by a panic sufferer and lead them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. Some begin to worry excessively and even quit jobs or refuse to leave home to avoid future attacks.  Panic disorder can be diagnosed when several apparently spontaneous attacks lead to a persistent concern about future attacks.  A common complication of panic disorder is [[agoraphobia]] -- anxiety about being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing (Craske, 2000; Gorman, 2000).

==Phobia==
{{main|Phobia}}

This category involves a strong, irrational fear and avoidance of an object or situation.  The person knows the fear is irrational, yet the anxiety remains.  Phobic disorders differ from generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorders because there is a specific stimulus or situation that elicits a strong fear response.  Imagine how it would feel to be so frightened by a spider that you would try to jump out of a speeding car to get away from it.  This is how a person suffering from phobia might feel.

People with phobias have especially powerful imaginations, so they vividly anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering such feared objects as knives, bridges, blood, enclosed places, or certain animals.  These individuals recognize that their fears are excessive and unreasonable but are generally unable to control their anxiety.

In addition to specific phobias, such as fears of knives, rats or spiders, there is another category of phobias known as social phobias.  Individuals with this disorder experience intense fear of being negatively evaluated by others or of being publicly embarrassed because of impulsive acts.  Almost everyone experiences &quot;stage fright&quot; when speaking or performing in front of a group.  But people with social phobias become so anxious that performance is out of the question.  In fact, their fear of public scrutiny and potential humiliaton becomes so pervasive that normal life is impossible (den Boer 2000; Margolis &amp; Swartz, 2001). Another social phobia is [[love-shyness]], which most adversely affects certain men. Those afflicted find themselves unable to initiate intimate adult relationships (Gilmartin 1987).

==Obsessive-compulsive disorder==
{{main|Obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are distressing, repetitive thoughts or images that the individual often realizes are senseless. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that the person feels forced or compelled into doing, in order to relieve anxiety. One example would be the obsession of extreme cleanliness and fear of contamination, which may lead to the compulsion of having to wash one's hands hundreds of times a day. Another example may be the obsession that one's door is unlocked, which may lead to the constant checking and rechecking of doors.

==Treatment overview==

Mainstream treatment for anxiety consists of the prescription of [[anxiolytic]] agents and/or referral to a [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] therapist. There are indications that a combination of the two can be more effective than either one alone.

===Prescription medication===

The acute symptoms of anxiety are most often controlled with anxiolytic agents such as [[benzodiazepine]]s. [[Diazepam]] (valium) was one of the first such drugs. Today we see a wide range of anti-anxiety agents that are based on benzodiazepines, although only two have been approved for panic attacks, [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]] and [[Alprazolam|Xanax]].  All benzodiazepines are physically addictive, and extended use should be carefully monitored by a physician, preferably a psychiatrist. It is very important that once placed on a regimen of regular benzodiazepine use, the user should not abruptly discontinue the medication. 

Some of the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have been used with varying degrees of success to treat patients with chronic anxiety, the best results seen with those who exhibit symptoms of clinical depression and non-specific anxiety or general anxiety disorder concurrently.  [[Beta blockers]] are also sometimes used to treat the somatic symptoms associated with anxiety, especially the shakiness of &quot;stage fright.&quot;

Many scientists believe that the benzodiazepines and other antianxiety drugs are greatly overprescribed and potentially addictive. See, for example, [[Fred Leavitt]]'s ''The REAL Drug Abusers'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003). The addicitive nature of the benzodiazepine class became apparent in the mid 1960's when Valium (Diazepam), the first drug in the class to win FDA approval, resulted in thousands of people who quickly showed the classic symptoms of addiction when used for more than a week or two consistently. 

The most addictive of the benzodiazepines appears to be [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] due to its rapid onset and short half life in the blood stream. Xanax also has the dubious distinction of being the only benzodiazepine that often requires hospitalization for discontinuation as a precaution against dangerous and sometimes fatal seizures as part of the detoxification process. No other medications in this class have shown this fatal side effect, although abrupt discontinuation of virtually any benzodiazepine can result in cravings, stomach pains, cramps, increased anxiety, insomnia and other signs of withdrawal.

===Cognitive-behavioral therapy ===

[[Cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is the most popular and effective form of [[psychotherapy]] used to treat anxiety. The goal of the cognitive-behavioral therapist is to decrease avoidance behaviors and help the patient develop coping skills. This 
may entail:

* Challenging false or self-defeating beliefs.
* Developing a positive self-talk skill.
* Developing negative thought replacement.
* Systematic [[desensitization]], also called ''exposure'' (used for [[agoraphobia]] and [[OCD]] mainly).
* Providing knowledge that will help the patient cope. (For example, someone who suffers from panic may be informed that fast, prolonged, heart palpitations are in themselves harmless).

Unlike prescription medication, the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy depends on various subjective factors, such as therapist competence.  In addition to conventional therapy, there are at-home cognitive-behavioral programs sufferers can use as part of their treatment.

===Other coping strategies===

A variety of over the counter supplements and medications are also used for their alleged anti-anxiety properties, however there is little scientific evidence to back up these claims. [[Kava Kava]] is a popular herbal treatment; small doses either taken regularly through the day or when early symptoms are noticed by the patient. [[Valerian root]] is also reputed to have anti-anxiety and sedative properties, as are [[passion fruit]], [[passion flower]], [[St. John's wort]], [[hops]], and [[chamomile]].

Popular nutritional supplements for dealing with anxiety include [[magnesium]] and [[B vitamins|B-complex]] vitamins.

Self help and relaxation techniques also play an important role in relieving anxiety symptoms. Self help includes:

* Proper diet - This includes reduction in consumption of caffeine, sugar, and generally an improvement of eating habits. Caffeine reduction should be gradual. Some anxiety sufferers report considerable reductions in their anxiety just from taking these measures.
* Exercise - Some exercise is thought to relieve stress. Anxiety sufferers should note that rapid heart palpitations during exercise can trigger a panic attack, so it is probably better to gradually develop an exercise routine while on a cognitive-behavioral program.
* Laughing
* Breathing techniques and proper breathing - A diaphragmic breathing technique is often recommended (as opposed to chest breathing).
* Proper sleep.
* Relaxation techniques - A state of relaxation can be achieved with the help of relaxation tapes, [[Yoga]] or [[relaxation therapy]].
* Stress management.- This may entail changes in lifestyle and time management. There are a number of books specialized in stress management.
* Panic attack coping strategies - Specific strategies for dealing with panic episodes have been proposed, such as slow abdominal breathing and use of reassuring self-talk.
* Search for meaning and purpose - Some experts have indicated that residual generalized anxiety can be the result of a sort of &quot;[[boredom]]&quot; about existence. They recommend looking for an occupation the sufferer finds meaningful. 

[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcoholic drinks]] are probably the most widely used substance for the alleviation of anxiety. Anxiety sufferers are cautioned that alcohol is also a powerful depressant and has a plethora of dangerous and uncomfortable side effects in addition to being highly addictive.

==Anxiety in palliative care==
Some research has strongly suggested that treating anxiety in [[cancer]] patients improves their quality of life. The treatment generally consists of counselling, relaxation techniques or pharmacologically with benzodiazepines.

==Anxiety and alternative medicine==

A 2002 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm survey (see table 3 on page 9)] found that [[complementary and alternative methods]] were used to treat anxiety/[[clinical depression|depression]] by 4.5 percent of U.S. adults who used CAM.

==Existential anxiety==

Theologians like [[Paul Tillich]] and psychologists like [[Sigmund Freud]] have characterized anxiety as the reaction to what Tillich called, &quot;The trauma of nonbeing.&quot; That is, the human comes to realize that there is a point at which they might cease to be (die), and their encounter with reality becomes characterized by anxiety. [[Religion]], according to both Tillich and Freud, then becomes a carefully-crafted coping mechanism in response to this anxiety.

==Test anxiety==

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam. Students suffering from test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth, embarrassment by a teacher, taking a class that is beyond their ability, fear of alienation from parents or friends, time pressures, or feeling a loss of control.  Emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physical components can all be present in test anxiety. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, and drumming on a desk are all common. An optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam; however, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, it results in a decline in performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:A._A._Milne.jpg|thumb|right| A.A. Milne.]]
'''Alan Alexander Milne''' ([[January 18]], [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[January 31]], [[1956]]), also known as '''A. A. Milne''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], best known for his [[book]]s about the animated [[teddy bear]], [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]], and for various children's poems. Milne had made several reputations, most notably as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.

==Biography==

Milne was born in [[Scotland]] but raised in [[London]] at a small private school in Kilburn run by his father John Vine Milne. One of his teachers was [[H. G. Wells]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he studied on a [[mathematics]] [[scholarship]]. While there, he edited and wrote for ''[[Granta]]'', a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later assistant editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. 

His son [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]] was born in [[1920]]. Milne joined the [[British Army]] in [[World War I]] but after the war wrote a denunciation of war titled ''[[Peace with Honour]]'' ([[1934]]) (which he retracted somewhat in [[1940]] with ''[[War with Honour]]''). 

During the war, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English comic writer [[P.G. Wodehouse]], who was captured at his country home in [[France]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the lighthearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near [[treason]] by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories. 

In [[1925]], Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]]. He retired to the farm after brain surgery in [[1952]] left him an invalid.

== Literary career ==

Milne is most famous for his Pooh books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]], after his son, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie the Pooh|Winnie-the-Pooh]]. (Reputedly, a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named Winnie (after [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]), used as a military mascot by the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, a Canadian Infantry Regiment in World War I and left to [[London Zoo]] after the war, is the source of the name.) [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own teddy, Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;) as the model; Christopher Robin's own toys are now under glass in New York.

The overwhelming success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased, and who until then had found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[JM Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a durable, character-led and witty piece of detective writing in ''The Red House Mystery'' -- indeed, his publisher was displeased when he announced his intention to write poems for children -- and he had never lacked an audience. 

But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said Goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot;, the approximate length of the four children's books, he had no intention of producing a copy of a copy, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (&quot;God help it&quot;) was simply &quot;Christopher Robin grown up ... what an obsession with me children are become!&quot;  

Even his old home, ''Punch'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography ''The Enchanted Places'', though Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author). 

After Milne's death, the rights to the Pooh characters were sold by his widow, Daphne to [[the Walt Disney Company]], which has made a number of Pooh cartoon movies, as well as a large amount of Pooh-related merchandise. She also destroyed his papers.

Milne also wrote a number of poems, including ''Vespers'', ''They're Changing Guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]'', and ''King John's Christmas'', which were published in the books ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'' and ''[[Now We Are Six]]''.
His poems have been parodied many times, including the books When We Were Rather Older and  ''[[Now We Are Sixty]]''.

He also adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' could not survive translation to the theater.

== Biographies ==

Milne's friend Frank Swinnerton's book ''The Georgian Literary Scene'' contains a substantial section about him; his son has written several books of autobiography: ''The Enchanted Places'', in particular, is an account of his attempt to escape from the shadow of a famous father and a burdensome name; ''The Path Through the Trees'' continues the story into adult life. Ann Thwaites' ''AA Milne: His Life'' is an excellent and detailed biography, although it gives little space to the plays; a spin-off book tells the story for a younger readership, concentrating on Pooh.

'''Addiction''' is a [[compulsion]] to repeat a behaviour regardless of its consequences. A person who is addicted is sometimes called an '''addict'''. 

There is a lack of consensus as to what may properly be termed 'addiction.' Some within the medical community maintain a rigid definition of addiction and contend that the term is only applicable to a process of escalating drug or alcohol use as a result of repeated exposure. However, addiction is often applied to compulsive [[behavior]]s other than drug use, such as overeating or gambling. In all cases, the term addiction describes a chronic pattern of behaviour that continues despite the direct or indirect adverse consequences that result from engaging in the behavior. It is quite common for an addict to express the desire to stop the behaviour, but find himself or herself unable to cease. 

Addiction is often characterized by a craving for more of the drug or behavior, increased [[physiological tolerance]] to exposure, and [[withdrawal]] symptoms in the absence of the stimulus. Many drugs and behaviours that provide either pleasure or relief from pain pose a risk of addiction or [[chemical dependency|dependency]].

==Terminology and usage==
The medical community now makes a careful theoretical distinction between ''physical dependence'' (characterized by symptoms of [[withdrawal]]) and ''psychological addiction'' (or simply ''addiction''). Addiction is now narrowly defined as &quot;uncontrolled, compulsive use despite harm&quot;; if there is no harm being suffered by, or damage done to, the patient or another party, then clinically it may be considered compulsive, but within this narrow definition it is not categorized as &quot;addiction&quot;. In practice, however, the two kinds of addiction are not always easy to distinguish. Addictions often have both physical and psychological components.

There is also a lesser known situation called [[pseudo-addiction]], where a patient will exhibit drug-seeking behaviour reminiscent of psychological addiction, however in this case, the patients tend to have genuine pain or other symptoms that have been undertreated.  Unlike true psychological addiction, however, these behaviours tend to stop as soon as their pain is adequately treated. 
The term &quot;''[[dry drunk]]''&quot; is sometimes attached to patterns of behavior that persist after an object of dependence and/or misuse
has been removed from daily living routines.  This type of behaviour is fairly common in early recovery for those recovering from substance misuse.   

The obsolete term ''physical addiction'' is deprecated, because of its connotations. In modern pain management with opioids: physical dependence is nearly universal but addiction is rare. Some of the highly addictive drugs (''[[hard drug]]s''), such as [[cocaine]], induce relatively little physical dependence.

Not all doctors do agree on what addiction or dependency is*, particularly because traditionally, addiction has been defined as being possible only to a psychoactive substance (for example [[alcoholism|alcohol]],  [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco]], or [[drug addiction|drugs]]), which is ingested, crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]], and alters the natural chemical behaviour of the brain temporarily. Many people, both psychology professionals and laypersons, now feel that there should be accommodation made to include psychological dependency on such things as [[gambling]], [[overeating|food]], [[hypersexuality|sex]], [[pornography addiction|pornography]], [[computer addiction|computers]], [[workaholic|work]], and [[shopping]] / spending. However, these are things or tasks which, when used or performed, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and hence, do not fit into the traditional view of addiction. Symptoms mimicking withdrawal may occur with abatement of such behaviours; however, it is said by those who adhere to a traditionalist view that these withdrawal-like symptoms are not strictly reflective of an addiction, but rather of a behavioural disorder. In spite of traditionalist protests and warnings that overextension of definitions may cause the wrong treatment to be used (thus failing the person with the behavioural problem), popular media, and some members of the field, do represent the aforementioned behavioural examples as addictions.
*note: the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM IVR) specifically spells out criteria to define abuse and dependence conditions.

==Varied forms of addiction==
===Physical dependency===
''Physical dependency'' on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic [[withdrawal]] symptoms when the drug is suddenly discontinued. While opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol and nicotine are all well known for their ability to induce physical dependence, other drugs share this property that are not considered addictive: cortisone, [[beta-blockers]] and most antidepressants are examples. So while physical dependency can be a major factor in the psychology of addiction, the primary attribute of an addictive drug is its ability to induce euphoria while causing harm.  

Some drugs induce [[withdrawal|physical dependence]] or [[physiological tolerance]] - but not addiction - for example many [[laxative]]s, which are not psychoactive; nasal [[decongestants]], which can cause rebound congestion if used for more than a few days in a row; and some [[antidepressants]], most notably [[Effexor]] and [[Paxil]], as they have quite short [[half-lives]], so stopping them abruptly causes a more rapid change in the neurotransmitter balance in the brain than many other antidepressants.  Many non-addictive prescription drugs should not be suddenly stopped, so a doctor should be consulted before abruptly discontinuing them.

The speed with which a given individual becomes addicted to various substances varies with the substance, the frequency of use, the means of ingestion, and the individual. Some [[alcoholic]]s report they exhibited alcoholic tendencies from the moment of first intoxication, while most people can drink socially without ever becoming addicted. Because of this variation, some people hypothesise that physical dependency and addiction are in large part genetically moderated. [[Nicotine]] is one of the most addictive [[psychoactive]] substances: although 35 million smokers make an attempt to quit every year, less than 7% achieve even one year of abstinence.* 

While [[eating disorders]], like other behavioral addictions, are usually considered primarily psychological disorders, they are sometimes treated as addictions, especially if they include elements of addictive behavior. Sufferers may experience withdrawal or withdrawal-like symptoms if they alter their diet suddenly. This suggests that some common food substances, especially [[chocolate]], [[sugar]], [[salt]] and white flour may have the potential for addiction. In addition, frequent [[Wiktionary:overeat|overeat]]ing can also be considered an addiction.

* From the NIDA research report on nicotine addiction.

===Psychological addiction===
''[[Psychological addictions]]'' are a dependency of the mind, and lead to psychological withdrawal symptoms. Addictions can theoretically form for any rewarding behavior, or as a habitual means to avoid undesired activity, but typically they only do so to a clinical level in individuals who have emotional, social, or [[Mental illness|psychological dysfunctions]], taking the place of normal positive stimuli not otherwise attained (see [[Rat Park]]).

== Addiction and drug control legislation == 

Most countries have legislation which brings various drugs and drug-like [[substance]]s under the control of licensing systems. Typically this legislation covers any or all of the opiates, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, hallucinogens and a variety of more modern synthetic drugs, and unlicensed production, supply or possession is a criminal offence. 

Usually, however, drug classification under such legislation is not related simply to addictiveness. The substances covered often have very different addictive properties. Some are highly prone to cause physical dependency, whilst others rarely cause any form of compulsive need whatsoever.

Also, although the legislation may be justifiable on moral or public health grounds, it can make addiction or dependency a much more serious issue for the individual: reliable supplies of a drug become difficult to secure, and the individual becomes vulnerable to both criminal abuse and legal punishment.

==Methods of care== 

Early editions of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) described addiction as a physical dependency to a substance that resulted in withdrawal symptoms in its absence. Recent editions, including DSM-IV, have moved toward a diagnostic instrument that classifies such conditions as dependency, rather than addiction. The [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] recommends treatment for people with chemical dependency based on [[patient placement criteria]] (currently listed in PPC-2), which attempt to match levels of care according to clinical assessments in six areas, including:
* Acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential 
* Biomedical conditions or complications 
* Emotional/behavioral conditions or complications 
* Treatment acceptance/resistance 
* [[Relapse]] potential 
* Recovery environment 

Some medical systems, including those of at least 15 states of the United States, refer to an [[Addiction Severity Index]] to assess the severity of problems related to substance use. The index assesses problems in six areas: medical, employment/support, alcohol and other drug use, legal, family/social, and psychiatric.

While addiction or dependency is related to seemingly uncontrollable urges, and may have roots in genetic predisposition, treatment of dependency is always classified as behavioral medicine. Early treatment of acute withdrawal often includes medical detoxification, which can include doses of [[anxiolytic]]s to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. In chronic opiate addiction, a surrogate drug such as [[methadone]] is sometimes offered as a form of [[opiate replacement therapy]]. But treatment approaches universally focus on the individual's ultimate choice to pursue an alternate course of action. 

Therapists often classify patients with chemical dependencies as either interested or not interested in changing. Treatments usually involve planning for specific ways to avoid the addictive stimulus, and therapeutic interventions intended to help a client learn healthier ways to find satisfaction. Clinical leaders in recent years have attempted to tailor intervention approaches to specific influences that effect addictive behavior, using therapeutic interviews in an effort to discover factors that led a person to embrace unhealthy, addictive sources of pleasure or relief from pain.

==Diverse explanations==
Several explanations (or &quot;models&quot;) have been presented to explain addiction:

*The ''[[moral]] model'' states that addictions are the result of human weakness, and are defects of [[moral character|character]]. Those who advance this model do not accept that there is any biological basis for addiction. They often have scant sympathy for people with serious addictions, believing either that a person with greater moral strength could have the force of will to break an addiction, or that the addict demonstrated a great moral failure in the first place by starting the addiction. The moral model is widely applied to dependency on illegal substances, perhaps purely for social or political reasons, but is no longer widely considered to have any therapeutic value. Elements of the moral model, especially a focus on individual choices, have found enduring roles in other approaches to the treatment of dependencies.  

*The ''[[opponent-process]] model'' generated by Richard Soloman states that for every psychological event A will be followed by its opposite psychological event B.  For example, the pleasure one experiences from heroin is followed by an opponent process of withdrawal, or the terror of jumping out of an airplane is rewarded with intense pleasure when the parachute opens. This model is related to the opponent process color theory.  If you look at the color red then quickly look at a gray area you will see green.  There are many examples of opponent processes in the nervous system including taste, motor movement, touch, vision, and hearing. Opponent-processes occurring at the sensory level may translate &quot;down-stream&quot; into addictive or habit-forming behavior. 

*The ''[[disease]] model'' holds that addiction is an illness, and comes about as a result of the impairment of healthy [[neurochemistry|neurochemical]] or behavioral processes. While there is some dispute among clinicians as to the reliability of this model, it is widely employed in therapeutic settings. Most treatment approaches involve recognition that dependencies are behavioral dysfunctions, and thus involve some element of physical or mental disease.

*The ''[[genetics|genetic]] model'' posits a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors. It is frequently noted that certain addictions &quot;run in the family,&quot; and while researchers continue to explore the extent of genetic influence, there is strong evidence that genetic predisposition is often a factor in dependency. Researchers have had difficulty assessing differences, however, between social causes of dependency learned in family settings and genetic factors related to [[heredity]].

*The ''[[culture|cultural]] model'' recognizes that the influence of culture is a strong determinant of whether or not individuals fall prey to certain addictions. For example, alcoholism is rare among [[Saudi Arabia]]ns, where obtaining alcohol is difficult and using alcohol is prohibited. In North America, on the other hand, the incidence of [[gambling]] addictions soared in the last two decades of the [[20th century]], mirroring the growth of the gaming industry. Half of all patients diagnosed as alcoholic are born into families where alcohol is used heavily, suggesting that familiar influence, genetic factors, or more likely both, play a role in the development of addiction.

*The ''blended model'' attempts to consider elements of all other models in developing a therapeutic approach to dependency. It holds that the mechanism of dependency is different for different individuals, and that each case must be considered on its own merits.

*The ''[[habit]] model'' proposed by [[Thomas Szasz]] questions the very concept of &quot;addiction.&quot; He argues that addiction is a metaphor, and that the only reason to make the distinction between habit and addiction &quot;is to persecute somebody.&quot; [http://www.szasz.com/drugsandfreedom1973.html (Szasz, 1973)]

*The genetic neurobiological model called Hypoism. Read about the science behind this and its implications at http://www.nvo.com/hypoism. The scientific argument is at: http://www.nvo.com/hypoism/hypoismhypothesis/

==Neurobiological basis==
The development of addiction is thought to involve a simultaneous process of 1) increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and 2) the attenuation or &quot;shutting down&quot; of other behaviors. For example, animals allowed the unlimited ability to self-administer psychoactive drugs will show such a strong preference that they will forgo food, sleep, and sex for continued access. The neuro-anatomical correlate of this that the brain regions involved in driving goal-directed behavior grow increasingly selective for particular motivating stimuli and rewards, to the point that the brain regions involved in the inhibition of behavior can no longer effectively send &quot;stop&quot; signals. A good analogy is to imagine flooring the gas pedal in a car with very bad brakes. In this case, the limbic system is thought to be the major &quot;driving force&quot; and the orbitofrontal cortex is the substrate of the top-down inhibition. 

A specific portion of the limbic circuit known as the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is hypothesized to play an important role in translation of motivation to motor behavior- and reward-related learning in particular.  It is typically defined as the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of dopamine-containing fibres that connecting them. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or sexual interaction. However, ita importance to addiction research goes beyond its role in &quot;natural&quot; motivation:  while the specific site or mechanism of action may differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, such as through blockade of the dopamine re-uptake mechanism (see [[cocaine]]). It may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens (see [[opiates]]). The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are thought to be a direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.   

The human body has a natural tendency to maintain [[homeostasis]], and the central nervous system is no exception. Chronic elevation of dopamine will result in a decrease in the number of dopamine [[Transmembrane receptor|receptors]] available in a process known as [[downregulation]]. The decreased number of receptors changes the permeability of the cell membrane located post-synaptically, such that the post-synaptic neuron is less excitable- ie, less able to respond to chemical signalling with an electrical impulse, or [[action potential]]. It is hypothesized that this dulling of the responsiveness of the brain's reward pathways contributes to the inability to feel pleasure, known as [[anhedonia]], often observed in addicts. The increased requirement for dopamine to maintain the same electrical activity is the basis of both [[physiological tolerance]] and [[withdrawal]] associated with addiction.

Downregulation can be classically conditioned. If a behavior consistently occurs in the same environment or contigently with a particular cue, the brain will adjust to the presence of the conditioned cues by decreasing the number of available receptors in the absence of the behavior. It is thought that many drug overdoses are not the result of a user taking a higher dose than is typical, but rather that the user is administering the same dose in a new environment.  

In cases of physical dependency on [[depressant]]s of the [[central nervous system]] such as opioids, [[barbiturate]]s, or alcohol, the absence of the substance can lead to symptoms of severe physical discomfort. Withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines (valium-family) can result in seizures and even death. By contrast, withdrawal from opioids, which can be extremely uncomfortable, is rarely if ever life-threatening. In cases of dependence and withdrawal, the body has become so dependent on high concentrations of the particular chemical that it has stopped producing its own natural versions (endogenous ligands) and instead produces opposing chemicals. When the addictive substance is withdrawn, the effects of the opposing chemicals can become overwhelming. For example, chronic use of sedatives (alcohol, [[barbiturate]]s, or benzodiazepines) results in higher chronic levels of stimulating [[neurotransmitter]]s such as glutamate. Very high levels of glutamate kill nerve cells (called excitatory neurotoxicity).

==Criticism==
[[Levi Bryant]] has criticized the term and concept of ''addiction'' as counterproductive in psychotherapy as it defines a patient's identity and makes it harder to become a ''non-addict''.  &quot;The signifier 'addict' doesn't simply describe what I am, but initiates a way of relating to myself that informs how I relate to others.&quot;

A stronger form or criticism comes from [[Thomas Szasz]], who denies that addiction is a psychiatric problem.  In many of his works, he argues that addiction is a choice, and that a drug addict is one who simply prefers a socially taboo substance rather than, say, a low risk lifestyle.  In 'Our Right to Drugs', Szasz cites the biography of [[Malcolm X]] to corroborate his economic views towards addiction: Malcolm claimed that quitting cigarettes was harder than shaking his heroine addiction.  Szasz postulates that humans always have a choice, and it is foolish to call someone an 'addict' just becuase they prefer a [[drug]] induced [[euphoria]] to a more popular and socially welcome lifestyle.

A similar conclusion to that of Thomas Szasz may also be reached through very different [[reasoning]].  This is the somewhat extreme, yet tenanable, view that humans do not have [[free will]]. From this perspective, being 'addicted' to a substance is no different than being 'addicted' to a job that you work everyday.  Without the assumption of free will, every human action is the result of the naturally occuring reactions of particle matter in the physical brain, and so there is no longer room for the concept of 'addiction', since, in this view, choice is an illusion of the [[human]] experience.

==Casual addiction==
The word addiction is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to something a person has a passion for. Such &quot;addicts&quot; include:

*[[Bibliophilia|Biblioholics]]
*[[Chocoholic]]s
*[[Workaholic]]s

In [[epistemology]], an '''axiom''' is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] truth upon which other knowledge must rest, from which other knowledge is built up.  Not all [[epistemologist]]s agree that any axioms, understood in that sense, exist. 

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom''' is ''not'' necessarily a ''self-evident'' truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in a deduction to yield further results. Mathematics distinguishes two types of axioms: [[#Logical axioms|logical axioms]] and [[#Non-logical axioms|non-logical axioms]].

==Etymology==

The word ''axiom'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word
&amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omega;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha; (''axioma''), which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered [[self-evidence|self-evident]].  The word comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu; (''axioein''), meaning to deem worthy, which in turn comes from &amp;alpha;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (''axios''), meaning worthy. Among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]]s an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof.

==Mathematics==

In the field of [[mathematical logic]], a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: '''logical axioms''' and '''non-logical axioms'''. 

===Logical axioms===

These are certain [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Formula|formulas]] in a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|language]] that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:ValidFormula|universally valid]], that is, formulas that are [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Satisfaction|satisfied]] by every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Structure|structure]] under every [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableAssignmentFunction|variable assignment function]] . In colloquial terms, these are statements that are ''true'' in any possible universe, under any possible interpretation and with any assignment of values.  Usually one takes as logical axioms some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all [[tautology|tautologies]] in the language.

====Examples====

In the [[propositional calculus]] it is common to take as logical axioms all formulas of the following forms, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be any formulas of the language:

#&lt;math&gt;\phi \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to (\psi \to \chi)) \to ((\phi \to \psi) \to (\phi \to \chi))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \phi \to \lnot \psi) \to (\psi \to \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Each of these patterns is an ''[[axiom schema]]'', a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are propositional variables, then &lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B))&lt;/math&gt; are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms.  It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and ''[[modus ponens]]'', one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus.  It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with ''modus ponens''.

These axiom schemata are also used in the [[predicate calculus]], but additional logical axioms are needed.

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order language. For each variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

This means that, for any [[Mathematical logic#Definition:FirstOrderLanguage|variable symbol]] &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by &lt;math&gt;x = x\,&lt;/math&gt; (or, for all what matters, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol &lt;math&gt;=\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be enforced, and [[mathematical logic]] does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example, is that which provides us with what is known as '''universal instantiation''':

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 3px double #CCCCCC; padding-left: 5px; &quot;&gt;
'''Example.''' Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, a variable &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Mathematical logic#Definition:Term|term]] &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; that is [[Mathematical logic#Definition:VariableSubstitutionInFormula|substitutable]] for &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;, the formula

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and that if &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim &lt;math&gt;P(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Again, ''we are claiming that the formula'' &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \phi \to \phi^x_t&lt;/math&gt; ''is valid'', that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a ''metaproof''. Actually, these examples are ''metatheorems'' of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of ''proof'' itself. Aside from this, we can also have '''existential generalization''':

&lt;/center&gt;

is universally valid.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Non-logical axioms===

'''Non-logical axioms''' are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions.  Reasoning about two different structures, for example the [[natural number]]s and the [[integer]]s, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as [[group (algebra)|groups]]).  Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not ''tautologies''.  Another name for a non-logical axiom is ''postulate''.

Almost every modern [[mathematical theory]] starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas. This turned out to be impossible and proved to be quite a story (''[[#role|see below]]'').

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as ''axioms'' in mathematical discourse.  This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense.  For example, in some [[group (algebra)|groups]], the group operation is [[commutative]], and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

Thus, an ''axiom'' is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the [[rules of inference]] define a '''deductive system'''.

====Examples====

This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as [[arithmetic]], [[real analysis]] (sometimes referred to as ''the theory of functions of one real variable''), [[linear algebra]], and [[complex analysis]] (a.k.a. ''complex variables''), are often introduced non-axiomatically in mostly technical studies, but any rigorous course in these subjects always begins by presenting its axioms.

''Geometries'' such as [[Euclidean geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]]. Interestingly one of the results of the fifth Euclidean axiom being a non-logical axiom is that the three angles of a triangle do not by definition add to 180°. Only under the umbrella of Euclidean geometry is this always true.

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through [[point set topology]], [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]], and all the related paraphernalia, such as [[homology theory]], [[homotopy theory]]. 
The development of ''abstract algebra'' brought with itself [[group theory]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[Galois theory]].

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including [[axiomatic set theory]], [[measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[probability]], [[representation theory]], and [[differential geometry]].

=====Arithmetic=====

The [[Peano axioms]] are the most widely used ''axiomatization'' of [[arithmetic]].  They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about [[number theory]] and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]].

We have a language &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT} = \{0, S\}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant symbol and &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unary function]] and the following axioms:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \lnot (Sx = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x. \forall y. (Sx = Sy \to x = y) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;((\phi(0) \land \forall x.\,(\phi(x) \to \phi(Sx))) \to \forall x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{L}_{NT}\,&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; with one free variable.

The standard structure is &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N} = \langle\N, 0, S\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\N\,&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers, &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[successor function]] and &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====

Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 [[Euclid's postulates]] of [[plane geometry]].  This set of axioms turns out to be incomplete, and many more postulates are necessary to rigorously characterize his geometry ([[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] used 23).

The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the [[parallel postulate|fifth (parallel) postulate]] (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four.  Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four.  Indeed, one can assume that no parallels through a point outside a line exist, that exactly one exists, or that infinitely many exist.  These choices give us alternative forms of geometry in which the interior [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] add up to less than, exactly, or more than a straight line respectively and are known as [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]], [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] geometries.

=====Real analysis=====

The object of study is the [[real numbers]].  The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to [[isomorphism]]) by the properties of a ''complete ordered field''. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of [[second-order logic]]. The [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]]s tell us that if we restrict ourselves to [[first-order logic]], any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger.  Some of the latter are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

===&lt;span id=&quot;role&quot;&gt;Role in mathematical logic&lt;/span&gt;===

====Deductive systems and completeness====

A '''deductive system''' consists, of a set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; of logical axioms, a set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of non-logical axioms, and a set &lt;math&gt;\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; of ''rules of inference''.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be '''complete'''.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash \phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

that is, for any statement that is a ''logical consequence'' of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; there actually exists a ''deduction'' of the statement from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;.  [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the completeness of a certain commonly-used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], which states that no ''recursive'', ''consistent'' set of non-logical axioms &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; of the Theory of Arithmetic is ''complete'', in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; such that neither &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of '''''completeness of a deductive system''''' and on the other hand that of '''''completeness of a set of non-logical axioms'''''.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===

Early [[mathematician]]s regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of [[physical space]], and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as [[Boolean algebra]] made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic.  [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted, but that the grand parallels between axiomatic systems could be put to good use, as he algebraically solved many classical geometrical problems.  Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and [[abstract algebra|modern algebra]] was born.  In the modern view we may take as axioms any set of formulas we like, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

:''For other uses, see [[Alpha]].''

'''Alpha''' (uppercase Α, lowercase α) is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]].  In the system of [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 1. It derives from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Aleph (letter)|'Aleph]][[Image:phoenician_aleph.png|20px|Aleph]]. Letters that arose from Alpha include the Latin [[A]] and the Cyrillic letter [[A (Cyrillic)|A]].

[[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' presents a discussion on the question of why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Plutarch's speaker suggests that [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenician]] who reputedly settled in [[Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, &quot;placed ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]], which they, like [[Hesiod]], considered not the second or third, but the first of necessities.&quot; This refers to a passage in ''[[Works and Days]]'' by Hesiod, who advised the early Greek farmers, &quot;First get an ox, then a woman.&quot;  A simpler explanation is that it was the first letter in the Phoenician alphabet.

According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]]. Oxen were also associated with the Moon in both early [[Sumerian]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] religious symbolism due to the crescent shape of their horns.

Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to or describe a variety of things, including the first or most significant occurrence of something.  [[Jesus]] declares himself to be the &quot;Alpha and [[Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|latin A]].

The lower-case letter α is used as the symbol for the following in physics:
* [[Angular acceleration]].
* The [[alpha particle]] and [[alpha decay]].
* Molecular polarisability.

==Other uses==

Alpha is also used to describe the strongest male in a pack of animals, known as the alphamale.

'''Alvin Toffler''' (born [[October 3]], [[1928]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] and [[futures studies|futurist]], known for his works discussing the [[digital revolution]], [[communications revolution]], [[corporate revolution]] and [[technological singularity]]. A former associate editor of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, his early work focused on technology and its impact (through effects like [[information overload]]). Then he moved to examining the reaction of and [[Social change|changes in society]]. His later focus has been on the increasing power of [[21st century]] military hardware, weapons and technology proliferation, and [[capitalism]]. He is married to [[Heidi Toffler]], also a writer and futurist.

== His ideas ==

Toffler explains, &quot;Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest.  Society needs people who work in hospitals.  Society needs all kinds of skill that are not just cognitive; they're emotional, they're affectional.  You can't run the society on data and computers alone.&quot;

In his book ''The Third Wave'' Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of 'waves' - each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside.
*First Wave is the society after [[agrarian revolution]] and replaced the first [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures.
*The main components of the Second Wave society are [[nuclear family]], factory-type education system and the [[corporation]]. Toffler writes: &quot;The Second Wave Society is industrial and based on [[mass production]], [[mass distribution]], [[mass consumption]], [[mass education]], [[mass media]], [[mass recreation]], [[mass entertainment]], and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of [[organization]] we call [[bureaucracy]].&quot; 
*Third Wave is the [[post-industrial]] society. Toffler would also add that since late 1950s most countries are moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society.  He coined lots of words to describe it and mentions names invented by other people, like the [[Information Age]].

In this post-industrial society, there is a lot of diversity in [[lifestyle]]s (&quot;subcults&quot;).
[[Adhocracy|Adhocracies]] (fluid organizations like, say, the [[Wikipedia community]]) adapt quickly to [[change]]s.
[[Information]] can substitute most of the material resources (see [[ersatz]]) and becomes the main material for workers ([[cognitarian]]s instead of [[proletarian]]s), who are loosely affiliated.
[[Mass customization]] offers the possibility of cheap, personalized, production catering to small niches (see [[Just In Time]] production).
The gap between producer and consumer is bridged by technology.
&quot;[[Prosumer]]s&quot; can fill their own needs (see [[open source]], [[assembly kit]], [[freelance]] work).

Since the 1960s, people have been trying to make sense of the impact of new technologies and social change. Toffler's writings have been influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic and public policy discussions.  [[Techno music]] pioneer [[Juan Atkins]] cites Toffler's phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; in ''Future Shock'' as inspiring him to use the word &quot;techno&quot; to describe the [[musical genre|musical style]] he helped to create.

Toffler's works and ideas have been subject to various criticism, usually with the same argumentation used against [[future studies|futurology]], that is that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible. In the 1990s, his ideas were publicly lauded by [[Newt Gingrich]].

== His books ==

A few of his well-known works are:

* ''[[The Eco-Spasm Report]]'' ([[1975]]) Bantam Books ISBN 055314474X

[[Image:Firstissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (Volume 1), March 1963, by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is the title of a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], a [[television program]] and a daily [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]]. All three feature the adventures of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].

==Comic book ==

Spider-Man originally appeared in issue #15 of the comic book ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', its final issue.  The series was cancelled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that the new title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' was launched, issue #1 appearing in March 1963.

The character was created by writer/editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/cowriter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues of ''Amazing''.  A disagreement over a story led to Ditko leaving the title after that point.  He was replaced by penciller [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]] who illustrated Lee's stories for several years. Although many fans thought that the writing quality almost instantly plummeted, the series became still more popular.

Many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic over the years chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero. The title was published continuously until 1998 when Marvel Comics decided to begin anew by renumbering the title with a new issue #1 published in January, 1999. In 2003 this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, at issue #500.

As of October 2005, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is participating in &quot;[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]&quot;, a 12-part crossover, which will conclude in January 2006.

[[Image:Blackissue.jpg|thumb|Cover to ''The Black Issue'' which is just a black background.]]
===Black Issue===

An issue of Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 2) called &quot;The Black Issue&quot; explores how Spider-Man and other heroes would react to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr]]. It starts with a double page spread of the devastation and of Spidey holding his head in pain/anguish/disbelief, his only word &quot;...God...&quot; The issue continues as Spidey swings down to help in the aftermath. Joining with other heroes in the rescue efforts, Spidey explores the wreckage and the broken hearts and his thoughts drive on, thinking through it all. At some point his thoughts become Straczynski's reflections and response. The script journeys from horror, pain and loss to end on strength.

==Television program==
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)}}
Spidey got his shot at live-action TV stardom in April 1977, when he debuted in the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; TV series.  Nicholas Hammond portrayed Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the short-lived series, which had started out as a slew of TV-movies, obviously made to capitalize on the [[The Incredible Hulk]] television series.  The show was canceled a year after its debut.

==Newspaper comic strip==

The daily newspaper comic strip began on [[January 3]], [[1977]]. It was first written by Spider-Man co-creator [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]].  The strip was surprisingly successful in an era with few serialized adventure strips.  The strip slowly grew in circulation and [[as of 2006]] is still being published.  Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] illustrated and later wrote the strip for much of its run. While the strip and the comic book feature the same characters, they do not share the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the strip has had a decreased emphasis on [[supervillain]] enemies.  A rare exception was the 1987 wedding of [[Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] which occurred in both the comic book and the comic strip.  Guest stars in the newspaper strip include [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Dr. Strange]].  Villains include [[Dr. Doom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[The Rhino]].  Stories from the strip have been reprinted in paperback and in [[Comics Revue]] magazine.

==Video and computer games==
{{see details|Spider-Man (games)}}
Numerous video and computer games have been released whereby the player controlled Spider-Man and had to do battle with various enemies.

==Trivia==
The 2004 movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was at one point tentatively titled ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.

'''Antigua and Barbuda''' is an [[island nation]] located in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the boundary with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Antigua]] ({{IPA2|ænˈtiːgə}}) and [[Barbuda]] ({{IPA2|bɑrˈbjuːdə}})are located in the middle of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the Eastern [[Caribbean]], roughly 17 degrees north of the equator. Antigua and Barbuda are part of the [[Lesser Antilles]] [[archipelago]] with the archipelago of [[Guadeloupe]] to the south, [[Montserrat]] to the southwest, [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] to the west and [[Saint Barthélemy]] and [[Saint Martin]] to the northwest. 
== History ==
''Main article: [[History of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Pre-ceramic [[Amerindian]]s were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and [[Barbuda]] in [[2400 BC]]. Later [[Arawak]] and [[Carib]] [[Amerindian]] tribes populated the islands. The island of Antigua was originally named Wadadli by the natives.  [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on his second voyage in 1493 and gave the island the name Antigua. Early settlements by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] were succeeded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] who formed a [[colony]] in 1667 by transporting [[Irish Catholic]] slaves to Antigua. [[Slavery]], established to run the [[sugar]] plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. 

The islands became an independent state within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on [[1 November]] [[1981]], and [[Vere Bird]] became the first [[prime minister]].

== Politics ==
''Main article:'' [[Politics of Antigua and Barbuda]]

Antigua and Barbuda is a [[Commonwealth Realm]] and the [[head of state]] is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], who is represented in Antigua and Barbuda by a [[governor general]]. [[executive branch|Executive power]] is in the hands of the [[prime minister]], who is also the [[head of government]]. The prime minister is usually the leader of the winning party of the elections for the [[House of Representatives of Antigua and Barbuda|House of Representatives]] (17 members), held every five years. The other chamber of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|parliament]], the [[Senate of Antigua and Barbuda|Senate]], has 17 members which are appointed by the governor general. Its current prime minister is [[Baldwin Spencer]] ([[24 March]] [[2004]]-).

== Administrative Divisions ==
''Main article: [[Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

The island of Antigua is divided into six [[parish]]es:-

{|
|
*&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint George Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint George]]
*&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint John Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John]]
*&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Mary Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Mary]]
|
*&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Paul Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Paul]]
*&lt;small&gt;5&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Peter Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Peter]]
*&lt;small&gt;6&lt;/small&gt; [[Saint Philip Parish, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint Philip]]
|
[[Image:Antigua_parishes_numbered.png|right|px150|The Parishes of Antigua]]
|}

The island of [[Barbuda]] and the uninhabited island of [[Redonda]] each enjoy dependency status.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Antigua and Barbuda map.png|250px|thumb|right| ]] 
:''Main article: [[Geography of Antigua and Barbuda]]''
The country consists of a number of islands, of which Antigua is the largest one, and the most populated. [[Barbuda]], just north of Antigua is the other main island. The islands have a warm, tropical [[climate]], with fairly constant temperatures year round. The un-inhabited island of [[Redonda]] also belongs to the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

The islands are mostly low-lying, with the highest point being [[Boggy Peak]], at 402 [[metre]]s (1,319 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The small country's main town is the capital [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John's]] on Antigua; Barbuda's largest town is [[Codrington]].

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

[[Tourism]] dominates its economy, accounting for more than half of its [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Weak tourist arrival numbers since early 2000 have slowed the economy, however, and pressed the government into a tight fiscal corner. The dual-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labour (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work. 

[[Manufacturing]] comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], which accounts for about one-third of all tourist arrivals.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Most of the population are descendants of the slaves that used to work in the sugar plantations, but there are also groups of Europeans, notably [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]], British and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. While the official language is [[English language|English]], most of the locals speak [[patois]], a form of [[Creole language#English Creole|Creole English]].

Almost all Antiguans are [[Christianity|Christians]], with the [[Anglican Church]] (about 44%) being the largest denomination.

==Foreign relations==
''Main article: [[Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda]]''

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]], [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], and the Eastern Caribbean's [[Regional Security System]].

'''''A Man for All Seasons''''' is a play by [[Robert Bolt]], first performed in [[London]] on [[July 1]] [[1960]]. It has subsequently been made into a feature film and a television movie.

{{spoiler}}

The plot is based on the true story of Sir [[Thomas More]], the [[16th century|16th-century]] Chancellor of [[England]], who refuses to endorse or denounce the [[monarch|king's]] wish to divorce his aging wife so that he can marry his mistress. The King is [[Henry VIII of England]] and his wife is [[Catherine of Aragon]], the first of an eventual six.  

The play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as [[Thomas Cromwell]] and loved by the common people and by his family.  

[[Image:A Man for All Seasons.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Thomas More ([[Paul Scofield]]) is accused of [[high treason]] by Cromwell ([[Leo McKern]]) - 1966 film]] [[Paul Scofield]], who played the leading role in the [[West End]], reprised it on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[1962]], winning a [[Tony Award]], and played More again in the first of two film versions ([[1966]]), winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in the process. The film also stars [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Henry VIII, [[Orson Welles]] as [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]], a young [[John Hurt]] as More's nemesis [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and an older [[Wendy Hiller]] as More's second wife. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]]. In addition to the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] won by Scofield, the film won [[Academy Awards]] for screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|cinematography]], costume design, [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].  

The [[1988]] version stars [[Charlton Heston]] (who also directed it) as More, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (who appeared briefly in the [[1966]] version as [[Anne Boleyn]]) as More's wife, and Sir [[John Gielgud]] as Cardinal Wolsey.

More recently, the play has been staged in London's West End at the [[Theatre Royal]], Haymarket starring [[Martin Shaw]] and produced by [[Bill Kenwright]].  It closes on [[1 April]] [[2006]].

==Quotation==
[[Image:man4all.JPG|thumb|200px]]

'''Alice:'''    Arrest him!

'''More:'''     Why, what has he done? 

'''Margaret:''' He's bad! 

'''More:'''     There is no law against that. 

'''Roper:'''    There is! God's law! 

'''More:'''     Then God can arrest him. 

'''Roper:'''    Sophistication upon sophistication. 

'''More:'''     No, sheer simplicity. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal, not what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal. 

'''Roper:'''    Then you set man's law above God's! 

'''More:'''     No, far below; but let me draw your attention to a fact -- I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain sailing, I can't navigate. I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh, there I'm a forrester.I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow me there, thank God. 

'''Alice:'''    While you talk, he's gone! 

'''More:'''     And go he should, if he was the Devil himself, until he broke the law! 

'''Roper:'''    So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law! 

'''More:'''     Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? 

'''Roper:'''    I'd cut down every law in England to do that! 

'''More:'''     Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down -- and you're just the man to do it -- do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.
 
----
'''More:'''     It profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... but for Wales, Richard?

'''Azincourt''' (sometimes: '''Agincourt''') is a village and [[commune in France|commune]] of northern [[France]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''[[départment]]'', 14 miles to the north-west of [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] by road, famous on account of the victory, on [[October 25]] [[1415]], of [[Henry V of England]] over the French in the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Population (1999): 276.

The original museum of the battle featuring model knights fabricated from [[Action Man]] has given way to a more professional space with slide shows, audio commentary's and some interactive elements. The museum building is itself modelled on the [[English longbow]] of the English soldiers.

{{Audio|De-Albert_Speer.ogg|'''Albert Speer'''}} ([[March 19]], [[1905]] &amp;ndash; [[September 1]], [[1981]]) was born ''Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer'' in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]], the second of three sons. He is sometimes called 'the first architect of the [[Third Reich]]'. He  was [[Hitler|Hitler's]] chief [[architect]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[1942]] became Hitler's minister of armaments, when he had considerable success in reforming and streamlining Germany's war production. After the war he was tried at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] where he expressed remorse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. After his release, he became a successful author, writing a number of semi-autobiographical works until his death in 1981 from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

==Early years==
Although Speer originally wanted to become a [[mathematics|mathematician]] when he was young, he ended up following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture. He began his architectural studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; his decision to study locally instead of at one of the more prestigious institutes was dictated by the inflation of 1923. In 1924 when the inflation had stabilised, Speer transferred his studies to the more esteemed Munich Institute of Technology. In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the Berlin Institute of Technology. It was there that he was under the tutelage of [[Heinrich Tessenow]], Speer had a high regard for Tessenow and when he passed his exams in 1927 he became Tessenow's assistant. His duties as assistant involved teaching seminar classes three days a week. Although Tessenow himself never agreed with [[Nazism]], a number of his students did, and it was they who persuaded Speer to attend a [[Nazi Party]] rally in a Berlin beer-hall in December 1930. 

Speer claims to have been apolitical as a young man; nevertheless, he did attend the rally. He was surprised to find Hitler dressed in a neat blue suit, rather than the brown uniform seen on Nazi Party posters. Speer claimed to have been quite affected, not only with Hitler's proposed solutions to the threat of communism and his renunciation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], but also with the man himself. Several weeks later he attended another rally, though this one was presided over by [[Goebbels|Joseph Goebbels]]. Speer was disturbed by the way he had whipped the crowd into a frenzy, playing on their hopes. Although Goebbels' performance offended Speer, he could not shake the impressions Hitler made on him. The next day he joined the Nazi Party as member number 474,481. In this same year ([[1931]]) he married [[Margarete Weber]].

Speer's first major commission as a Party member came in [[1932]] when [[Karl Hanke]] (whose [[villa]] Speer previously worked on) recommended him to Goebbels to help renovate the new District Headquarters in [[Berlin]], and, later, to renovate Goebbels' [[Propaganda]] Ministry.  Goebbels was impressed with his work and recommended him to Hitler, who assigned him to help [[Paul Troost]] renovate the Chancellery in Berlin.  Speer's most notable work on this assignment was the addition of the famous balcony from which Hitler often presented himself to crowds that assembled below. Speer subsequently became a prominent member of Hitler's inner circle and a very close friend to him, winning a special place with Hitler that was unique amongst the Nazi leadership. Hitler, according to Speer, was very contemptuous towards anybody he viewed as part of the [[bureaucracy]], and prized fellow artists like Speer whom he felt a certain kinship with, especially as Hitler himself had previously entertained architectural ambitions.

==First Architect of the Reich==
When Troost died in [[1934]], Speer was chosen to replace him as the Party's chief architect.  One of his first commissions after promotion was perhaps the most familiar of his designs: the [[Zeppelintribune]], the [[Nuremberg]] parade grounds seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda masterpiece, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In his autobiography, Speer claimed that, upon seeing the original design, he made a derogatory remark to the effect that the parade ground would resemble a &quot;rifle club&quot; meet. He was then challenged to create a new design.

The grounds were based on ancient [[Doric order|Doric]] architecture of the [[Pergamon Altar]] in [[Anatolia]], but magnified to an enormous scale, capable of holding two hundred and forty thousand people.  At the 1934 Party rally on the parade grounds, Speer surrounded the site with one hundred and thirty [[anti-aircraft]] [[searchlight|searchlights]].  This created the effect of a &quot;cathedral of light,&quot; (which referenced [[columns]]) or, as it was called by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ambassador|Ambassador]] [[Sir Neville Henderson]], a &quot;cathedral of ice&quot;.

Nuremberg was also to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings, most of which were never built; for example, the German Stadium would have held another four hundred thousand spectators as the site of the [[Aryan Games]], a proposed replacement for the [[Olympic Games]].  While planning these buildings, Speer invented the theory of &quot;[[ruin value]].&quot;  According to this theory, enthusiastically supported by Hitler, all new buildings would be constructed in such a way that they would leave aesthetically pleasing ruins thousands of years in the future.  Such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of the [[Third Reich]], just as ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins were symbols of the greatness of their civilizations.

In [[1937]] Speer designed the [[Germany|German]] Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale de Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 international exposition in Paris]]. Speer's work was located directly across from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Pavilion and was designed to represent a massive defense against the onslaught of [[communism]]. Both pavilions were awarded gold medals for their designs.

Speer was also directed to make plans to rebuild Berlin, which was to become the [[capital]] of a &quot;Greater Germany&quot; &amp;mdash; [[Welthauptstadt Germania]]. The first step in these plans was the [[Olympic Stadium, Berlin|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], designed by [[Werner March]]. Speer also designed the [[new German Reichs Chancellery|new Reichs Chancellery]], which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]].  Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger Chancellery, although it was never begun.  The second Chancellery was damaged by the [[Battle of Berlin]] in [[1945]] and was eventually demolished  by the Soviet occupiers after the war.
[[Image:Adolf Hitler in Paris.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Speer (left) with Hitler and [[Arno Breker]] in Paris, [[June 23]], [[1940]].]]

Almost none of the other buildings planned for Berlin were ever built. Berlin was to be reorganized along a central three-mile-(five km) long avenue.  At the north end, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'' &amp;mdash; an enormous [[dome|domed]] building, based on [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].  The dome of the building would have been impractically large; it would be over seven hundred feet (over two hundred meters) high and eight hundred feet (three hundred meters) in diameter, sixteen times larger than the dome of St. Peter's.  At the southern end of the avenue would be an [[arch]] based on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, but again, much larger; it would be almost four hundred feet (120 m) high, and the Arc de Triomphe would have been able to fit inside its opening.  The outbreak of [[World War II]] in [[1939]] led to the abandonment of these plans.

During his involvement in the rebuilding of Berlin, he was allegedly responsible for the forced evictions of [[Jew]]s from their houses to make room for his grand plans, and for re-housing German citizens affected by this work. He was also listed as being present at the 1943 [[Posen Conference]], a charge Speer later contested by saying that he had in fact left early.

Speer did have an architectural rival: [[Hermann Giesler]], whom Hitler also favored.  There were frequent clashes between the two in regard to architectural matters and in closeness to Hitler.

==Minister of Armaments==
Hitler was always a strong supporter of Speer, in part because of Hitler's own frustrated artistic and architectural visions. A strong affinity developed between Hitler and the ambitious young architect early in their professional relationship. For Speer, serving as architect for the head of the German state and being given virtual ''carte blanche'' as to expenses, presented a tremendous opportunity. For Hitler, Speer seemed to be capable of translating Hitler's grandiose visions into tangible designs which expressed what Hitler felt were [[Nazism|National Socialist]] principles.

After Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Fritz Todt]] was killed in an airplane crash in [[1942]], Hitler appointed Speer as his successor in all of his posts. Hitler's affinity for Speer and the architect's efficiency and avoidance of party squabbling are believed to have been considerations in Speer's promotion. In his autobiography, Speer recounts that the power-hungry but lazy [[Hermann Göring]] raced to Hitler's headquarters upon word of Todt's death, hoping to claim the office. Hitler instead presented Göring with the ''fait accompli'' of Speer's appointment. 

Faced with this new responsibility, Speer tried to put the German economy on a war footing comparable to that of the [[Allied]] nations, but found himself incessantly hindered by party politics and lack of cooperation from the Nazi hierarchy. Nevertheless, by slowly centralizing almost all industry control and cutting through the dense [[bureaucracy]], he succeeded in multiplying war production four times over the next two and a half years, with it actually reaching its peak in 1944 during the height of the [[Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II | strategic bombing campaign]]. Another big hurdle in his way was the Nazi policy excluding women from factory work, a serious hindrance in war production and a problem unknown to Germany's enemies, who all made full use of the female workforce. To fill this gap, Speer made heavy use of foreign labor, a considerable portion of it [[forced labor]].

Speer was considered one of the more &quot;rational&quot; members of the Nazi hierarchy, in contrast to the raging [[Hitler]], grotesque [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], fanatical [[Goebbels]], and perverse [[Himmler]].
Speer's name was found on the list of members of a post-Hitler government envisioned by the [[July 20 plot]] to kill Hitler.
However, the list had an annotation &quot;if possible&quot; by his name, which Speer credits with helping save his life from the extensive purges that followed the scheme's failure.
By his own account, Speer considered [[assassin|assassinating]] Hitler in [[1945]] by releasing poison gas into the air intake vent on the [[Führerbunker]], but backed down for a number of reasons. Independent evidence for this is sparse. Some credit his revelation of this plan at the [[Nuremberg trials]] as being pivotal in sparing him the [[death sentence]], which the [[Soviet]]s had pushed for.

Hitler continued to consider Speer trustworthy, though this trust waned near the war's end as Speer, at considerable risk, campaigned clandestinely to prevent the implementation of Hitler's [[scorched earth]] policy on both German soil and occupied territories. Speer worked in association with General [[Gotthard Heinrici]], whose troops fighting in the east retreated to the American-held lines and surrendered there instead of following Hitler's orders to make what would have been a suicidal effort to hold off the Soviets from Berlin.

Speer even confessed to Hitler shortly before the dictator's suicide that he had disobeyed, and indeed actively hindered, Hitler's &quot;scorched-earth&quot; decree.
According to Speer's autobiography, Speer visited the [[Führerbunker]] towards the end and stated gently but bluntly to Hitler that the war was lost and expressed his opposition to the systematic destruction of Germany while reaffirming his affection and faith in Hitler. This conversation, it is said, brought Hitler to tears. In disfavor, Speer was excluded from the new cabinet Hitler outlined in his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler |  final political testament]], where Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl-Otto Saur]].

==After the war==
[[Image:Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Speer at the Nuremberg Trials]]
===Nuremberg trials===
Immediately after the war, there seemed to be little indication that Speer would be charged with [[war crimes]]. Speer traveled unprotected and openly participated in the so-called [[Flensburg government]] for weeks, in the presence of Allied officers. Upon request, he actually held a series of widely-attended lectures for officials of the Allied occupying powers on various topics, including the mistakes made by the Nazi government in industrial and economic affairs (although he never during these lectures spoke about slave labor) and the effectiveness of the Allied [[strategic bombing]] campaigns. Some [[journalists]] and spectators even expected that Speer would be appointed by the occupying powers to help restore Germany's economy. However, any such speculation ended when, after one of these lectures, he was arrested and sent to Nuremberg for trial.
At the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war Speer was one of the few officials to express remorse and plead guilty, but was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in [[Spandau Prison]], [[West Berlin]], largely for his use of slave labor. At the trials, the prosecution introduced as evidence a photograph of Speer visiting the [[Mauthausen]] [[concentration camp]], where he is clearly shown surrounded by emaciated prisoners. The prosecution claimed this proved Speer was well aware of [[The Holocaust|the Holocaust]]. However, Speer held that he was only given a &quot;V.I.P.&quot; tour of the concentration camp, meaning he was never shown the more vile side of the camp's purpose.

According to interviews after his imprisonment, as well as his memoirs, Speer adopted a &quot;see no evil&quot; attitude towards the Nazi atrocities. For example, through one of his friends, [[Karl Hanke]], he learned of [[Auschwitz (concentration camp)|Auschwitz]] and the large number of deaths taking place there. He then purposely avoided visiting the camp or trying to get more information on what was taking place. In his autobiography, he claims that he had no direct involvement or knowledge of the Holocaust, although he faults himself for blinding himself to its existence. He certainly was aware, at least, of harsh conditions for the slave labor and some critics believe that his books understate his role in the atrocities of the era.  [http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/05/11/wspeer11.xml Newly released documents] suggest that Speer knew a lot more about the atrocities than he was telling, but hard evidence for that remains very thin.

One problem with assessments of Speer's complicity in the Holocaust comes from his status in post-war Germany - he became a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) any part in the regime's atrocities. Even today, German historians such as [[Joachim Fest]] tend to have a high opinion of him, while non-German historians take a lower view. As [[film director]] [[Heinrich Breloer]] remarked in the above-linked article:

::''[Speer created] a market for people who said &quot;believe me, I didn't know anything about [the Holocaust]. Just look at the Führer's friend, he didn't know about it either.&quot;''

===Imprisonment===
:''Main article: [[Spandau Prison]]''

His time in prison, painstakingly documented in his secret prison diary which was later released as ''[[The Spandau Diaries]]'', was described as consisting mainly of a mind-numbing and pedantically enforced daily routine, incessant petty personal rivalry between the seven prisoners, a pervasive and bloated prison [[bureaucracy]], and the passing of many false hopes of premature release. After some time Speer, and most of the others, had established secret lines of communication to the outside world via sympathetic prison staff. Speer made full use of this by, amongst other things, writing innumerable letters to his family (which were restricted to one outgoing page per month under official regulation) and even having money spent on his behalf from a special bank account for a variety of benign purposes.

Speer, as recounted in his diary, made a deliberate effort to make as productive use of his time as possible. In the first decade, this took the form of putting on paper the first draft of his tell-all [[memoirs]], an act Speer considered to be his &quot;duty&quot; to history and his people, he being the sole surviving member of Hitler's inner circle and in possession of knowledge and a degree of objectivity that no other had. As the prison directors both forbade the writing of a memoir and recorded each sheet of paper given to the prisoners, he wrote much of his memoir secretly on toilet paper, tobacco wrappings, and any other material he could get his hands on, and then had the pages systematically smuggled out.

All the while Speer devoted much of his energy and time towards reading books from the prison library, which was organized by fellow prisoner and ex-[[Grand Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]]. Speer was, more so than the others, a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years alone.{{ref|spandau}} His tastes ranged from Greek drama to famous plays to architectural books and journals, partly from which he collected information for a book he intended to write on the history and function of windows in architecture.

Later, Speer took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work. Heretofore the garden was divided up into small personal plots for each prisoner with the produce of the garden being used in the prison kitchen. When regulations began to slacken in this regard, Speer was allowed to build an ambitious garden, complete with a meandering path, [[rock garden]], and a wide variety of flowers. The garden was even, humorously, centered around a &quot;north-south axis&quot;, which was to be the core design element of Speer and Hitler's new Berlin. Speer then took up a &quot;walking tour of the world&quot; by ordering geography and travel books from the local library and walking laps in the prison garden visualizing his journey. Meticulously calculating every metre traveled, he began in northern Germany, went through the [[Balkans]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[India]], and [[Siberia]], then crossed the [[Bering Strait]] and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence in central [[Mexico]].

===Release===
His release from prison in [[1966]] was a world-wide media event. He then revised and published the several semi-[[autobiography|autobiographical]] books he had begun in prison.  His books, most notably ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''The Spandau Diaries'', which were secretly written during his incarceration and systematically smuggled out, provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era and have become much valued by historians. Speer died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in [[London]], [[England]], on [[September 1]], [[1981]] — exactly 42 years after World War II began.

Speer's son, also named Albert, became a successful [[architect]] in his own right, and was responsible for the design of [[Expo 2000]] (the [[world exposition]] that took place in [[Hanover]] in the year 2000), design of the [[Shanghai]] International Automobile City and the Beijing Olympic complex. His daughter [[Hilde Schramm]] became a noted left-wing parliamentarian.

'''Alliaceae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of herbaceous [[perennial]] plants. They are [[monocot]]s, part of [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Asparagales]].

Genus ''[[Allium]]'' includes several important food plants, including [[onion]]s (''Allium cepa''), [[chives]] (''A. schoenoprasum''), [[garlic]] (''A. sativum'' and ''A. scordoprasum''), and [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s (''A. porrum'').

The Alliaceae are closely related to two other families in the order Asparagales, the amaryllis family ([[Amaryllidaceae]]) and the family [[Agapanthaceae]], which includes the single genus ''[[Agapanthus]]''. Based on the close relationship between the three families, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] recognizes the alternative of including the Amaryllidaceae and the Agapanthaceae in family Alliaceae.

== Genera ==
Several genera that were historically classified in the Alliaceae, including ''[[Androstephium]]'', ''[[Bessera]]'', ''[[Bloomeria]]'', ''[[Brodiaea]]'', ''[[Dandya]]'', ''[[Dichelostemma]]'', ''[[Milla]]'', ''[[Petronymphe]]'', ''[[Triteleia]]'', and ''[[Triteleiopsis]]'', are now increasingly thought to represent a separate family, [[Themidaceae]].

The family '''Asteraceae''' or, alternatively, family '''Compositae''', known as the '''aster''', '''daisy''' or '''sunflower family''', is a taxon of [[dicot|dicotyledonous]] [[flowering plant]]s.  The family name is derived from the genus ''[[Aster (flower)|Aster]]'' and refers to the [[star]]-shaped flower head of its members, typified well by the [[daisy]].  The Asteraceae is the second largest family in the Division [[Flowering plant|Magnoliophyta]], with some 1,100 genera and over 20,000 recognized species. Only the orchid family ([[Orchidaceae]]) is larger, with about 25,000 described species.

Plants belonging to the Asteraceae must share ALL the following characteristics (Judd et al., 1999). None of these traits, taken separately, can be considered [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphic]].
* [[Inflorescence]]: a capitulum or flower head
* Syngenesious [[anther]]s, i.e. with the stamens fused together at their edges by the anthers, forming a tube
* [[Ovary]] with basal arrangement of the ovules
* [[Ovule]]s one per ovary
* Pappus (a tuft of hairs on a fruit)
* The fruit is an [[achene]]
* [[Terpene|Sesquiterpenes]] present in the essential oils, but iridoids lacking.

[[Image:Bidens_flwr.jpg|thumb|left|A typical Asteraceae flower head (here ''[[Bidens torta]]'') showing the individual flowers]]
The most common characteristic of all these plants, is that what in common parlance might be called a &quot;flower&quot;, is an inflorescence or '''flower head'''; a densely packed cluster of many small, individual [[flowers]], usually  called '''florets''' (meaning &quot;small flowers&quot;). 

Plants in the family Asteraceae typically have one or both of two kinds of ''florets''. The outer perimeter of a flower head like that of a [[sunflower]] is composed of florets possessing a long strap-like [[petal]], termed a '''ligule'''; these are the '''ray florets'''. The inner portion of the flower head (or ''disc'') is composed of small flowers with tubular [[petal|corolla]]s; these are the '''disc florets'''. The composition of asteraceous inflorescences varies from all ray flowers (like [[dandelion]]s, genus ''Taraxacum'') to all disc flowers (like [[pineapple weed]]s).

The composite nature of the inflorescences of these plants led early taxonomists to call this family the Compositae. Although the rules governing naming conventions for plant families state that the name should come from the [[biological type|type genus]], in this case ''Aster'' and thus Asteraceae. However, the long prevailing name Compositae is also authorized as an alternative family name ([[ICBN]] Art. 18.6). 

The numerous genera are divided into about 13 tribes. Only one of these, Lactuceae, is considered distinct enough to be a subfamily (subfamily Cichorioideae); the remainer, which are mostly overlapping, are put in the subfamily Asteroideae (Wagner, Herbst, and Sohmer, 1990).    

==Uses==
Commercially important plants in the Asteraceae include the food crops [[lettuce]], [[chicory]], [[globe artichoke]], [[sunflower]], and [[Jerusalem artichoke]]. [[Guayule]] is a source of [[hypoallergenic]] [[latex]].

Many members of Asteracae are copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] producers and are useful for evaluating [[pollinator]] populations during their bloom. ''Centaurea'' (knapweed), ''Helianthus annuus'' (domestic sunflower), and some species of ''Solidago'' (goldenrod) are major &quot;[[honey]] plants&quot; for [[beekeeper]]s. ''Solidago'' produces relatively high protein [[pollen]], which helps [[honeybee]]s overwinter.

Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, e.g., [[chrysanthemums]] and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry.  Some Asteraceae are economically important in the sense that they are considered noxious [[weeds]], e.g., [[dandelions]].

The '''Apiaceae''' or '''Umbelliferae''' (both names are allowed by the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|ICBN]]) are a family of usually aromatic [[plant]]s with hollow stems, including [[parsley]], [[carrot]], and other relatives. It is a large family with about 300 [[genus|genera]] and more than 3,000 [[species]]. The earlier name Umbelliferae derives from the [[inflorescence]] being in the form of a compound &quot;umbel&quot;.

The small flowers are radially symmetrical with 5 small [[sepal]]s, 5 [[petal]]s and 5 [[stamen]]s.

The family contains some highly [[toxic]] plants, such as [[hemlock]], which was used to execute [[Socrates]] and also used to poison arrow tips. It also contains some highly useful plants, such as carrots, parsley, [[caraway]], and [[fennel]]. Many plants in this family, such as [[wild carrot]] have [[estrogen]]ic properties, and have been used as [[folk medicine]] for [[birth control]]. Most notable for this use is the extinct giant fennel, [[silphium]].

Notable members include:
*''Anethum graveolens'' - [[Dill]]
*''Anthriscus cerefolium'' - [[Chervil]]
*''Angelica'' spp. - [[Angelica]]
*''Apium graveolens'' - [[Celery]]
*''Carum carvi'' - [[Caraway]]
*''Centella asiatica'' - [[Gotu kola]] (pennywort)
*''Conium maculatum'' - [[Conium|Poison hemlock]]
*''Coriandrum sativum'' - [[Coriander]]
*''Cuminum cyminum'' - [[Cumin]]
*''Daucus carota'' - [[Carrot]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''axon''', or '''nerve fiber''', is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron's [[cell body]] or soma. Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the [[nervous system]], and as bundles they help make up [[nerve]]s. Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one [[micrometre]] across - but may extend to [[macroscopic]] lengths. The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the big toe of each foot. These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.    

In [[vertebrate]]s, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in [[myelin]], which is formed by either of two types of [[glia|glial cells]]: [[Schwann cell]]s ensheathing [[PNS|peripheral]] neurons and [[oligodendrocyte]]s insulating those of the [[central nervous system]]. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the sheath known as [[nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly-spaced intervals, enabling an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction|saltation]]. The demyelination of axons is what causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease [[Multiple Sclerosis]].

The axons of some neurons branch to form [[axon collateral]]s, along which the bifurcated impulse travels simultaneously to signal more than one other cell.

==Growth &amp; Development==
Growing axons move through their environment via the [[growth cone]], which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called [[lamellipodia]] which contain protrusions called [[filopodia]]. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. [[Actin]] plays a major role in the mobility of this system. 

Environments with high levels of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s or CAM's create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAM's specific to neural systems include [[N-CAM]], neuroglial CAM or [[NgCAM]], [[TAG-1]], [[MAG]], and [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]], all of which are part of the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. Another set of molecules called [[extracellular matrix adhesion molecule]]s also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include [[laminin]], [[fibronectin]], [[tenascin]], and [[perlecan]]. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellants. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.

Cells called [[guidepost cells]] assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells are typically other, sometimes immature, neurons.

==History==
Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930's by K. Cole and H. Curtis. [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] also employed the [[squid giant axon]] (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential.
Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963.

The '''Aramaic alphabet''' is an [[abjad]] alphabet designed for writing the [[Aramaic language]]. As with other abjads, the letters all represent [[consonant]]s; a few [[matres lectionis]] are consonants that also represent long [[vowel]]s.

The earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. The use of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]] throughout the [[Middle East]] from the [[8th century BCE]] led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] (the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]).

The [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] alphabets are little changed in style from the Aramaic alphabet. The development of [[cursive]] versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrenean alphabet|Palmyrenean]] and [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic]] alphabets. These scripts formed the basis of the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]], [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] and [[Mongolian alphabet|Mongolian]] alphabets. Controversially, it is claimed that the Aramaic alphabet may be the forebear of the [[Indic alphabets]].

Today, [[Biblical Aramaic]], Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the [[Aramaic language]] of the [[Talmud]] are written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] is written in the [[Mandaic alphabet]].

[[Vannevar Bush]]'s essay '''''As We May Think''''', first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in July [[1945]], argued that as humans turned from war, scientific efforts should shift from increasing physical abilities to making all previous collected [[human]] [[knowledge]] more accessible.

The article was a reworked and expanded version of his 1939 ''Mechanization and the Record''. The system, which he called [[memex]], was described as based on what was thought, at the time, to be the wave of the future: Ultra high resolution [[microfilm]] reels, coupled to multiple screen viewers and cameras, by electromechanical controls. The ''Atlantic Monthly'' article was followed, in November [[1945]], by a [[Life magazine]] article which showed illustrations of the proposed memex desk and automatic typewriter.

''As We May Think'' predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication, including [[hypertext]], [[personal computers]], the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[speech recognition]], and [[online encyclopedia]]s such as Wikipedia: &quot;Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''American shot'''&quot; is a translation of a phrase from [[France|French]] [[film criticism]], &quot;''plan Americain''&quot; and refers to a medium-long (&quot;knee&quot;) [[Shot (film)|film shot]] of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of [[Cinema of the United States|American film]]s of the [[1930s]] or [[1940s]]; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' American movies, such as [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

'''Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis''' ('''ADEM''') is an immune mediated [[disease]] of [[human brain|brain]]. It usually occurs following a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or [[vaccination]], but it may also appear spontaneously.

There are multiple inflammatory cell deposits in the brain, particularly in the section 
called [[white matter]]. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and [[Adolescence|adolescents]].

It has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begins 1-3 weeks after infection or vaccination. Major symptoms are [[fever]], [[headache]], drowsiness, [[seizure]]s and [[coma]]. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, later in the course of the disease patients may even die, if they are not treated properly. Some patients recover completely, while others have permanent neurological impairments.

The first treatment is usually [[steroid]]s and [[intensive care]] is often required.

'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''ataxiā'', meaning failure to put in order) is unsteady and clumsy motion of the [[limb]]s or [[torso|trunk]] due to a failure of the gross coordination of [[muscle]] movements.

Ataxia often occurs when parts of the nervous system that control movement are damaged. People with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs, resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of gait. While the term ataxia is primarily used to describe this set of symptoms, it is sometimes also used to refer to a family of disorders. It is not, however, a specific diagnosis. 

Most disorders that result in ataxia cause cells in the part of the brain called the [[cerebellum]] to degenerate, or atrophy. Sometimes the spine is also affected. The phrases ''cerebellar degeneration'' and ''spinocerebellar degeneration'' are used to describe changes that have taken place in a person’s nervous system; neither term constitutes a specific diagnosis. Cerebellar and spinocerebellar degeneration have many different causes. The age of onset of the resulting ataxia varies depending on the underlying cause of the degeneration. 

Many ataxias are hereditary and are classified by chromosomal location and pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, in which the affected person inherits a normal gene from one parent and a faulty gene from the other parent; and autosomal recessive, in which both parents pass on a copy of the faulty gene. Among the more common inherited ataxias are [[Friedreich's ataxia]] and Machado-Joseph disease. Sporadic ataxias can also occur in families with no prior history. 

Ataxia can also be acquired. Conditions that can cause acquired ataxia include [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], tumors, [[lesion]]s of the [[central nervous system]] or spinal cord, alcoholism, peripheral neuropathy, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies. 

[[Dysdiadochokinesia]] is a sign of cerebellar ataxia.

[[University of Minnesota]] researchers suggested in 2006 that [[Abraham Lincoln]] may have suffered from spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, thus accounting for his clumsy gait.[http://www.startribune.com/1244/story/198437.html][http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/01/27/D8FD29HG0.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abdul Alhazred''', or the '''Mad Arab''', is a [[fictional character]] created by the horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The term &quot;Mad Arab&quot; in reference to Alhazred is always capitalised and used in the manner of an official title such as another person would be called &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; and the term can actually be used in lieu of Alhazred's name as a synonym.

''Abdul Alhazred'' is not a real [[Arabic name]], and seems to contain the Arabic definite article morpheme twice in a row (rather anomalous in terms of Arabic grammar).  The more proper Arabic form might be ''Abd-el-Hazred'' or simply ''Abdul Hazred'' (with a single definite article), although these are still anomalous, as ''Hazred'' is not one of the [[99 Names of God]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations, his name has appeared as ''Abdullah Alḥaẓred'' (عبدالله الحظرد). While this Arabic-alphabet spelling of ''Alhazred'' has no real meaning in the Arabic language, it is reminiscent of the verb [[triliteral|root]] ح ظ ر meaning &quot;to forbid.&quot;

According to Lovecraft's &quot;History of the [[Necronomicon]]&quot; (written [[1927]], first published [[1938]]), Alhazred was:

:[A] mad poet of [[Sanaá]], in [[Yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[Umayyad | Ommiade]] caliphs, circa [[700]] A.D. He visited the ruins of [[Babylon]] and the subterranean secrets of [[Memphis, Egypt |Memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[Arabia]] &amp;mdash; the [[Rub' al Khali|Roba el Khaliyeh]] or &quot;Empty Space&quot; of the ancients &amp;mdash; and &quot;Dahna&quot; or &quot;Crimson&quot; desert of the modern Arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. Of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. In his last years Alhazred dwelt in [[Damascus]].

In [[730]], while still living in Damascus, Alhazred supposedly authored in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] a book of ultimate evil, ''al Azif'', which would later become known as the ''[[Necronomicon]]''.

{{spoiler}}

Those who have any dealings with the Necronomicon usually come to an unpleasant end, and Alhazred was no exception. Again according to Lovecraft:

:Of his final death or disappearance ([[738]] A.D.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. He is said by [[Ibn Khallikan]] ([[13th century]] biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. Of his madness many things are told. He claimed to have seen fabulous [[Irem of the Pillars|Irem]], or City of Pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of a certain [[The Nameless City|nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. He was only an indifferent [[Muslim|Moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Cthulhu]].

[[August Derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of Alhazared. One change was redating Alhazared's death to [[731]]. Derleth further wrote on the final fate of Alhazred in his story &quot;[[The Keeper of the Key]]&quot;, first published in May, [[1951]]. In this story [[Dr. Laban Shrewsbury]] (a recurring Derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[Naylan Colum]], discovered Alhazred's burial site. More specifically they were heading a caravan from [[Salalah]], [[Oman]], and crossed the border into [[Yemen]]. There they found the unexplored desert area the Necronomicon names as &quot;Roba el Ehaliyeh&quot; or &quot;Roba el Khaliyeh&quot; -- perhaps a form of &quot;Rabia al-Awliya&quot; which, again, is not proper Arabic, but could be an allusion to the Sufi Saint Rabia (pure conjecture). More likely it refers the [[Empty Quarter]] or &quot;Rub al Khali&quot;. At the center of the area they discovered [[The Nameless City|the Nameless City]], a domain of [[Hastur]]. Shrewsbury, as an old agent of Hastur and devoted enemy of his half-brother [[Cthulhu]], crossed its gates in search of Alhazred's burial site. He indeed found the gate of Alhazred's burial chamber and learned of his fate. Alhazred was kidnapped in Damascus and brought to the Nameless City, where he had earlier studied and learned some of Necronomicon's secrets. As punishment for his betrayal of their secrets, Alhazred was tortured. Then they blinded him and severed his tongue, and finally executed him. The entrance to the chamber warned against disturbing him. But Shrewbury proceeded in entering the chamber and opening the sarcophagus. Though only rugs, bones and dust remained of Alhazred, the sarcophagus also contained an incomplete personal copy of the Necronomicon, written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Then Shrewsbury used [[Necromancy]] to recall Alhazred's spirit and ordered it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. After obtaining the map, which revealed the location of [[R'lyeh]] and other secret places, Shrewsbury finally let Alhazred return to his eternal rest.

==Pop culture==

[[Roberta Williams]] used the name &quot;Abdul Alhazred&quot; as the name of the villain in [[King's Quest 6]].

Marvel comics has also used the name Abdul Alhazred as a supervillian working for Apocalypse.

'''Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace''' ([[December 10]], [[1815]] &amp;ndash; [[November 27]], [[1852]]) is mainly known for having written a description of 
[[Charles Babbage]]'s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the [[analytical engine]].

== Life ==
Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his wife, [[Anne Isabella Milbanke|Annabella Milbanke]]. Ada was named after Byron's [[half-sister]], [[Augusta Leigh]], by whom he was rumoured to have fathered a child. It was Augusta who encouraged Byron to marry to avoid scandal, and he reluctantly chose Annabella. On [[January 16]], [[1816]], Annabella left Byron, taking 1-month old Ada with her. On [[April 21]], Byron signed the Deed of Separation and left England for good a few days later. He was never allowed to see either again.

Ada lived with her mother, as is apparent in her father's correspondence concerning her. Lady Byron was also highly interested in mathematics (Lord Byron once called her &quot;the queen of parallelograms&quot;), which dominated her life, even after marriage. Her obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons why Annabella taught Ada [[mathematics]] at an early age. Ada was privately schooled in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], one of her tutors being [[Augustus De Morgan]]. An active member of [[London]] society, she was a member of the [[Bluestockings]] in her youth.

[[Image:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ada Lovelace]]
In 1835 she married [[William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace|William King, 8th Baron King]], later [[Earl of Lovelace|1st Earl of Lovelace]]. They had three children; Byron born [[12 May]] [[1836]], Annabella ([[Lady Anne Blunt]]) born [[22 September]] [[1837]] and Ralph Gordon born [[2 July]] [[1839]]. The family lived at Ockham Park, at [[Ockham, Surrey]]. Her full name and title for most of her married life was '''The Right Honourable Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace'''. She is widely known in modern times simply as '''Ada Lovelace'''.

She knew [[Mary Somerville]], noted researcher and scientific author of the [[19th century]], who introduced her in turn to [[Charles Babbage]] on [[June 5]], [[1833]]. Other acquaintances were [[David Brewster|Sir David Brewster]], [[Charles Wheatstone]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Michael Faraday]].

During a nine-month period in 1842-1843, Ada translated for Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s memoir on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|a set of Notes]] which specified in complete detail a method for calculating [[Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, recognized by historians as the world's first [[computer program]].  Biographers note, however, that the programs were written by Babbage himself, and Lovelace simply found a mistake in the program for calculating Bernoulli numbers and sent it back for amendment.  The evidence and correspondence between Lovelace and Babbage indicate that he wrote all of the programs in the notes appended to the Menebrea translation.  Her prose acknowledged some possibilities of the machine which Babbage never published, such as speculating that &quot;the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.&quot;

Ada Lovelace died at 36 after being [[Bloodletting|bled]] to death by her physicians, who were trying to treat her [[uterine cancer]]. Thus, she died, ironically, not only at the same age as her father did, but even of the same cause - the mistaken custom of bloodletting. She left two sons and a daughter, [[Lady Anne Blunt]], famous in her own right as a traveller in the [[Middle East]] and a breeder of [[Arabian horse]]s.

At her own request, Lovelace was buried next to the father she never knew at the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall|Church of St. Mary Magdalene]] in [[Hucknall]], [[Nottingham]].

== Controversy over attribution ==

Biographers have noted that Lovelace struggled with mathematics, and there is some debate as to whether Lovelace understood deeply the concepts behind programming Babbage's engine, or was more of a figurehead used by Babbage for [[public relations]] purposes.

As an early woman in computing, Lovelace occupies a politically sensitive space in the canon of historical figures in [[computer science]], and therefore the extent of her contribution versus Babbage's remains difficult to assess based on current sources.

== Trivia ==

* On [[December 10]], [[1980]], (Ada's birthday), the [[U.S. Defense Department]] approved the reference manual for their new computer [[programming language]], called &quot;[[Ada programming language|Ada]]&quot;.
* The U.S. [[Defense Standard|Department of Defense Military Standard]] for Ada (MIL-STD-1815) was assigned a number to commemorate the year of her birth.
* On the math-mystery cartoon, ''[[Cyberchase]]'', she appears as the animated character Lady Ada Lovelace, voiced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' comedian [[Jane Curtin]].  The episode is &quot;Hugs and Witches&quot; (#201) which premiered February 14, 2002 on [[PBS Kids GO!]].
* She is one of the main characters in the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]], which posits a world in which Babbage's machines were [[mass production|mass produced]] and the computer age started a century early.
* ''Lord Byron's Novel'' by [[John Crowley]] is a pastiche of a novel supposedly by Byron (in real life he did begin writing one, but is not known to have completed it), discovered after his death by his daughter, edited and with commentary by her.
* Her image can be seen on the [[Microsoft]] product authenticity [[hologram]] stickers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Computer science|computer science]], the '''ambient calculus''' is a [[Process calculi|process calculus]] devised by [[Luca Cardelli]]
and [[Andrew D. Gordon]] in [[1998]], and used to describe and theorise about [[concurrent systems]] that include ''mobility''. Here ''mobility'' means both computation carried out on mobile devices (''i.e.'' networks that have a dynamic topology), and mobile computation (''i.e.'' executable code that is able to move around the network). The ambient calculus provides a unified framework for modeling both kinds of mobility {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. It is used to model interactions in such [[concurrent systems]] as the [[Internet]].

Since its inception, the ambient calculus has grown into a family of closely related [http://xdguan.freezope.org/wiki/AmbientCalculiOnline ''ambient calculi''].

== Informal description ==
===Ambients===
The fundamental primitive of the ambient calculus is the ''ambient''. An ambient is informally defined as a ''bounded'' place in which computation can occur. The notion of boundaries is considered key to representing mobility, since a boundary defines a contained computational agent that can be moved in its entirety {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. Examples of ambients include: 

* a web page (bounded by a file)
* a virtual address space (bounded by an addressing range)
* a Unix file system (bounded within a physical volume)
* a single data object (bounded by  “self”) 
* a laptop (bounded by its case and data ports)

The key properties of ambients within the Ambient calculus are:

* Ambients have names, which are used to control access to the ambient
* Ambients can be nested inside other ambients (representing, for example, administrative domains)
* Ambients can be moved as a whole

===Operations===
Computation is represented as the crossing of boundaries, ''i.e.'' the movement of ambients. There are three basic operations (or capabilities) on ambients {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}:
* &lt;math&gt;in\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to enter some sibling ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and then proceed as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;out\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to exit its parent ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;open\;m.P&lt;/math&gt; instructs the surrounding ambient to dissolve the boundary of an ambient &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; located at the same level
The Ambient calculus provides a reduction semantics that formally defines what the results of these operations are.

Communication ''within'' (''i.e.'' local to) an ambient is anonymous and asynchronous. Output actions release names or capabilities into the surrounding ambient. Input actions capture a value from the ambient, and bind it to a variable. ''Non-local'' I/O can be represented in terms of these local communications actions by a variety of means. One approach is to use mobile “messenger” agents that carry a message from one ambient to another (using the capabilities described above). Another approach is to emulate channel-based communications by modeling a channel in terms of ambients and operations on those ambients {{ref_harvard|Cardelli1998|Cardelli 1998|-}}. The three basic ambient primitives, namely '''in''', '''out''', and '''open''' are expressive enough to simulate name-passing channels in the [[Pi-calculus|&amp;pi;-calculus]].

== Criticisms ==
Some people believe that the synchronous nature of the three ambient actions ('''in''', '''out''', and '''open''') may make it difficult to adopt the ambient calculus as the programming language core for mobile and [[distributed computing]]. A counter-argument to this criticism is that the ambient calculus is not intended to act as a language core, but rather to provide general capabilities for formally modelling and analyzing complex concurrent systems that may consist of components written in a variety of languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|List of works by August Derleth}}

'''August William Derleth''' ([[February 24]] [[1909]] &amp;ndash; [[July 4]] [[1971]]) was an American writer and anthologist. The son of William Julius Derleth and his wife Rose Louise Volk, he resided in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]].

At the age of 16, he sold his first story to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Derleth wrote all throughout his four years at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and received a [[Bachelor's Degree|B.A.]] in 1930. During this time he served briefly as [[editor]] of ''[[Mystic Magazine]]''.

In the mid-1930s he organised a Ranger's Club for young people, served as clerk and president of the local [[Board of Education]], served as a parole officer, organised a local Men&amp;rsquo;s Club and a [[Parent-Teacher Association|parent-teacher association]]. He also lectured in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin.

Derleth was a contemporary and friend of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] &amp;mdash; when Lovecraft wrote about &quot;le Comte d'Erlette&quot; in [[List of Works by H. P. Lovecraft|his fiction]] it was in homage to Derleth. After Lovecraft's death he took a number of that author's unfinished stories and rewrote or finished them for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and later in book form. In the process, he invented the term [[Cthulhu Mythos]] to describe the invented [[mythology]] that seemed to lie behind much of Lovecraft's fiction. Derleth codified the Mythos to bring it more in line with his own [[Christianity|Christian]] conception of the battle between good and evil and, as other authors had done before him, added new gods and creatures to the stories.

When Lovecraft died in [[1937]], Derleth and [[Donald Wandrei]] put together a collection of that author's [[short story|stories]] and tried to get them published. With existing publishers showing little interest, they founded [[Arkham House]] in 1939 to do it themselves. The name of the company comes from Lovecraft's [[fictional town]] of [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]], which featured in many of his stories.

In [[1939]] Arkham House published ''[[The Outsider and Others]]'', a huge collection that contained most of Lovecraft's short stories then known to exist. Derleth and Wandrei soon decided to expand Arkham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book, ''[[Someone in the Dark]]'' in [[1941]], a collection of some of Derleth's own [[horror stories]].

In [[1941]] he became literary editor of ''[[The Capital Times]]'' newspaper in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], a post he held until his resignation in [[1960]].

Derleth was married [[April 6]] [[1953]] to Sandra Evelyn Winters, and they were divorced six years later in [[1959]]. He retained custody of their two children, April Rose and Walden William. In [[1960]], Derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called ''Hawk and Whippoorwill'', dedicated to [[poetry|poems]] of man and nature.

He died on [[July 4]] [[1971]] and is buried in [[St. Aloysius]] Cemetery, [[Sauk City]], Wisconsin.

Derleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime. Included among that number were several novels about a British detective named [[Solar Pons]], who was quite similar in many respects to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Derleth, however, lacked the knowledge to make the details of those stories authentic, as he had never been to [[England]]. He also wrote under the [[pseudonym|pseudonyms]] Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.

[[Image:Alps in the Chamonix Valley, near the Mer de Glace.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The West face of the Petit Dru above the [[Chamonix]] valley near the [[Mer de Glace]].]]
[[Image:Alpenrelief 01.jpg|thumb|275px|Digital relief of the Alps]]

The '''Alps''' (Alpi in Italian) is the name for one of the great [[mountain range]] systems of [[Europe]], stretching from [[Austria]], [[Italy]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east, through [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]] to [[France]] in the west. The word &quot;Alps&quot; was taken via [[French language|French]] from [[Latin]] ''Alpes'' (meaning &quot;the Alps&quot;), which may be influenced by the Latin words ''albus'' (white) or ''altus'' (high), or a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word. 

The highest mountain in the Alps is [[Mont Blanc]] at 4810&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] on the French-Italian border. All the main peaks of the Alps can be found in the [[list of mountains of the Alps]] and [[list of Alpine peaks by prominence]].

==Geography==
:''Main article: [[Geography of the Alps]]''

===Subdivision===
[[Image:Alpenrelief 02.jpg|thumb|275px|the Alps with the Borders of the Countries]]
[[Image:Italian alps1.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Italian Alps - Taken from an airplane]]
The Alps are generally divided into [[Western Alps]] and [[Eastern Alps]]. The division is along the line between [[Lake Constance]] and [[Lake Como]], following the [[Rhine]]. The Western Alps are located in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]], the Eastern Alps in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]]. The highest peak of the Western Alps is [[Mont Blanc]], 4810 m. The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is [[Piz Bernina]], 4052 meters.

The Eastern Alps are commonly subdivided according to the different geological composition of the more central parts of the Alps and the groups at its northern and southern fringes: [[Northern Limestone Alps]], [[Central Eastern Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]]. The border between the [[Central Eastern Alps]] and the [[Southern Limestone Alps]] is the [[Periadriatic Seam]]. The [[Northern Limestone Alps]] are separated from the [[Central Eastern Alps]] by the [[Grauwacken Zone]].

The [[Western Alps]] are commonly subdivided into the following:
*[[Ligurian Alps]]
*[[Maritime Alps]]
*[[Cottian Alps]]
*[[Dauphiné Alps]]
*[[Graian Alps]]
*[[Pennine Alps]]
*[[Bernese Alps]]
*[[Lepontine Alps]]
*[[Glarus Alps]]
*[[North-Eastern Swiss Alps]]

Series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chains of the Alps, including the [[French Prealps]].

===Main chains===
:''Main article: [[Main chain of the Alps]]''

[[Image:alps.space.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|The European Alps from space in May 2002.]]
The &quot;main chain of the Alps&quot; follows the watershed from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the north-west and then, near the [[Colle della Maddalena]], to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-north-east, a heading it follows until its end near [[Vienna]].

===Principal passes===
:''Main article: [[Principal passes of the Alps]]''

The Alps do not form an impassable barrier; they have been traversed for [[war]] and [[commerce]], and later by [[pilgrim]]s, [[student]]s and [[tourist]]s. Crossing places by [[road]], [[train]] or foot are called passes, these are depressions in the  mountains to which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones.

==Climate==
:''Main article: [[Climate of the Alps]]''

The ''climate of the Alps'' is the [[climate]], or average [[weather]] conditions over a long time, of the central Alpine region of [[Europe]]. As we rise from [[sea level]] into the upper regions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[temperature]] [[adiabatic lapse rate|decreases]]. The effect of [[mountain]] chains on prevailing [[wind]]s is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in [[volume]] at the cost of a proportionate loss of [[heat]], often accompanied by the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of moisture in the form of [[snow]] or [[rain]].

==Geology==
:''Main article: [[Geology of the Alps]]''

The Alps arose as a result of the pressure exerted on [[sediment]]s of the [[Tethys Ocean]] basin as its [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Cenozoic]] [[Stratum|strata]] were pushed against the stable [[Eurasia]]n landmass by the northward-moving [[Africa]]n landmass. Most of this occurred during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs. The pressure formed great recumbent folds, or ''nappes'', that rose out of what had become the [[Tethys Sea]] and pushed northward, often breaking and sliding one over the other to form gigantic thrust [[Geologic fault|fault]]s. [[Crystal]]line rocks, which are exposed in the higher central regions, are the rocks forming [[Mont Blanc]], the [[Matterhorn]], and high peaks in the Pennine Alps and Hohe Tauern.

The landscape seen today is mostly formed by [[glaciation]] during the past two million years. At least five [[ice age]]s have done much to remodel the region, scooping out the lakes and rounding off the limestone hills along the northern border. [[Glaciers]] have been retreating during the past 10,000 years, leaving large granite boulders scattered in the forests in the region.  As the last ice age ended, it is believed that the [[climate]] changed so rapidly that the glaciers retreated back into the mountains in a span of about 200 to 300 years.

==Political history==
:''Main article: [[Political history and modern state of the inhabitants of the Alps]]''

Little is known of the early dwellers in the Alps, save from the scanty accounts preserved  by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]s and [[geographer]]s.  A few details have come down to us of the conquest of many of the Alpine tribes by [[Augustus]].

The successive emigration and occupation of the Alpine region by various [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic tribes]] from the [[5th century|5th]] to the [[6th century|6th centuries]] are known only in outline, because to them, as to the [[Frankish]] kings and emperors, the Alps offered a route from one place to another rather than a permanent residence.

It is not until the final breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the [[10th century|10th]] and [[11th century|11th centuries]] that it becomes possible to trace out the local history of the Alps.

==Exploration==
:''Main article: [[Exploration of the High Alps]]''

The higher regions of the Alps were long left to the exclusive attention of the men of the adjoining valleys, even when Alpine travellers (as distinguished from Alpine climbers) began to visit these valleys. The two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were H.B. de Saussure (1740-1799) in the [[Pennine Alps]], and the Benedictine monk of [[Disentis]], Placidus a Spescha (1752-1833), most of whose ascents were made before 1806, in the valleys at the sources of the [[Rhine]].

==Flora==
A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s &amp;mdash; [[oak]], [[beech]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[sycamore maple]].  These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the wild [[herb]]aceous vegetation.  This limit usually lies about 1200 m above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to 1500 m, sometimes even to 1700 m.

It must not be supposed that this region is always marked by the presence of the characteristic trees. The interference of man has in many districts almost removed them, and, excepting the beech forests of the [[Austria]]n Alps, a considerable wood of deciduous trees is rare. In many districts where such woods once existed, their place has been occupied by the [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]], which suffer less from the ravages of goats, the worst enemies of tree vegetation. The mean annual temperature of this region differs little from that of the [[British Islands]]; but the climate conditions are widely different. Here snow usually lies for several months, till it gives place to a spring and summer considerably warmer than the average of British seasons.

'''Albert Camus''' (pronounced Kam-oo, [[IPA]]: ka.mʉ̟ː) ([[November 7]], [[1913]] &amp;ndash; [[January 4]], [[1960]]) was a  [[France|French]] [[author]] and [[philosopher]] and one of the principal luminaries (with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]) of [[absurdism]].  Camus was the second youngest-ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (after [[Rudyard Kipling]]) when he received the award in 1957. He is also the [[List of Nobel Prize in Literature winners by longevity|shortest-lived of any literature laureate]] to date, having died in a car crash three years after receiving the award.

==Early years== 
Albert Camus was born in [[Mondovi, Algeria]] to a French Algerian ([[pied noir]]) settler family. His mother was of Spanish extraction. His father, Lucien, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in [[1914]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], while serving as a member of the [[Zouave]] infantry regiment. Camus lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]].

In [[1923]], Camus was accepted into the [[lycée]] and eventually to the [[University of Algiers]]. However, he contracted [[tuberculosis]] in [[1930]], which put an end to his [[football (soccer)|football]] activities (he had been a [[goalkeeper]] for the university team) and forced him to make his studies a part-time pursuit. He took odd jobs including private [[tutor]], car parts clerk, and work for the Meteorological Institute. He completed his ''licence de philosophie'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in [[1935]]; in May of [[1936]], he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], ''Néo-Platonisme et Pensée Chrétienne'' for his ''diplôme d'études supérieures'' (roughly equivalent to an M.A. by thesis). 
{{French literature (small)}}
Camus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1934, apparently for concern over the political situation in [[Spain]] (which eventually resulted in the [[Spanish Civil War]]) rather than support for [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine. In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of [[Le Parti du Peuple Algérien]], which got him into trouble with his communist party comrades.  As a result, he was denounced as &quot;[[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]]&quot;, which did not endear him to Stalinist communism. 

In 1934, he [[Married|married]] Simone Hie, a [[morphine]] addict, but the marriage ended due to Simone's infidelity. In 1935, he founded ''Théâtre du Travail'' &amp;mdash; &quot;Worker's Theatre&quot; &amp;mdash; (renamed ''Théâtre de l'Equipe'' (&quot;Team's Theatre&quot;) in [[1937]]), which survived until 1939. From 1937 to 1939, he wrote for a socialist paper, ''Alger-Republicain'', and his work included an account of the peasants who lived in [[Kabylie]] in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected from the French army because of his [[tuberculosis]].

In 1940, Camus married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. Francine gave birth to twins Catherine and Jean Camus on September 5th, 1945. Also in this year, Camus began to work for ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' magazine. In the first stage of [[World War II]], the so-called [[Phony War]] stage, Camus was a [[pacifism|pacifist]]. However, he was in [[Paris]] to witness how the [[Wehrmacht]] took over. On [[December 15]], [[1941]], Camus witnessed the execution of [[Gabriel Peri]], an event which Camus later said crystallized his revolt against the Germans. Afterwards he moved to [[Bordeaux]] alongside the rest of the staff of ''Paris-Soir''. In this year he finished his first books, ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria in 1942.

== Literary career ==
During the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''Combat'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the [[moniker]] &quot;Beauchard&quot;. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943, and when the Allies liberated Paris Camus reported on the last of the fighting. He eventually resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947, when it became a commercial paper. It was here that he became acquainted with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

After the war, Camus became one member of Sartre's entourage and frequented ''[[Café de Flore]]'' on the [[Boulevard St. Germain]] in [[Paris]]. Camus also toured the [[United States]] to lecture about French existentialism. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]] politically, his strong criticisms of communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the communist parties and eventually also alienated Sartre. 

In 1949 his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published ''[[The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism. The book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France and led to the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays. 

Camus's most significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd, the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he explained in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Plague]]''. Some would argue that Camus is better described not as an [[existentialist]] (a label he would have rejected) but as an [[absurdist]].

In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952 he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the [[UN]] accepted [[Spain]] as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953 he was one of the few leftists who criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a worker's strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956 he protested similar methods in [[Hungary]]. 

He maintained his pacifism and resistance to [[capital punishment]] everywhere in the world. One of his most significant contributions was an essay collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler|Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.

When the [[Algerian War of Independence]] began in 1954 it presented a moral dilemma for Camus. He identified with [[pied-noir]]s, and defended the French government on the grounds that revolt of its North African colony was really an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States' (Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes, 1939-1958). Although favouring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even [[federation]], though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pied-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work clandestinely for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. 

From 1955 to 1956 Camus wrote for [[L'Express]]. In [[1957]] he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], officially not for his novel ''[[The Fall]]'', published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay &quot;Réflexions Sur la Guillotine&quot;. When he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question and stated that he was worried what could happen to his mother who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.

Camus died on [[January 4]], [[1960]] in a car accident near [[Sens]], in a place named &quot;Le Grand Frossard&quot; in the small town of Villeblevin.  Ironically, Camus had uttered a remark earlier in his life that the most absurd way to die would be in a car accident.

The plaque says: &quot;From the Yonne area's local council, in tribute to the writer Albert Camus who was watched over in the Villeblevin town hall in the night of the 4th to the 5th of January 1960&quot;]]
The driver of the [[Facel Vega]], [[Michel Gallimard]] -- his publisher and close friend -- also perished in the accident. Camus was interred in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[France]]. 

He was survived by his twin children, Catherine and Jean, who hold the copyrights to his work.

After his death, two of Camus's works were published posthumously.  The first was an earlier version of ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' and was published in [[1970]].  The second work was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'', that Camus was writing before he died.  The novel was an [[autobiographical]] work about his childhood in [[Algeria]] and was published in [[1995]].

==Summary of Absurdism==
[[Image:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus' gravestone]]
Many writers have written on the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the Absurd. For example, Sartre does little more than acknowledge it while Kierkegaard bases the existence of the God on the fact of the absurd. Camus was not the originator of Absurdism and regretted the continued reference to him as a ''philosopher of the absurd''. He shows less and less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (The Myth of Sisyphus). To distinguish Camus's ideas of the Absurd from those of other philosophers, people sometimes refer to the '''Paradox of the Absurd''', when referring to ''Camus's Absurd''.

His early thoughts on the Absurd appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (The Wrong Side and the Right Side) in 1937. Absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (Nuptials), in 1938. In these essays Camus does not offer a philosophical account of the Absurd, or even a definition; rather he reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an Absurd life as ''L'Étranger'' (The Stranger/Outsider), and in the same year releases ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (The Myth of Sisyphus), a literary essay on the Absurd. He had also written a play about a Roman Emperor, Caligula, pursuing an Absurd logic. However, the play was not performed until 1945. The turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of letters to a fictitious German friend, published in the newspaper ''Combat''.

===Camus' ideas on the Absurd===
In the essays Camus presented us with dualisms; happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He wanted us to face up to the fact that happiness is fleeting and that we will die. He did this not to be morbid, but so we can love life and enjoy our happiness when it occurs. In ''Le Myth'', this dualism became a paradox; we value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. Whilst we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Myth'', Camus was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?

Meursault, the Absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger'', is a murderer who is executed for his crimes. Caligula ends up admitting his Absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, Camus, while obviously suggesting that Caligula's Absurd reasoning is wrong, exalts Meursault as the only Messiah we deserve. ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' raises questions it cannot satisfactorily answer. 

Camus' work on the Absurd was intended to promote a public debate. His various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus. In the essay ''Enigma'', Camus expressed his frustration at being labeled a philosopher of the absurd. None of his previous work was intended to be a definitive account of his thoughts on the Absurd, although the ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' is often mistaken as such. 

Camus made a significant contribution to our understanding of the Absurd, but was not himself an Absurdist. &quot;If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.&quot; ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.

'''Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] ([[September 15]], [[1890]] &amp;ndash; [[January 12]], [[1976]]), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[crime fiction]] writer. She also wrote romances under the name '''Mary Westmacott'''.

Agatha Christie is the world's best-known mystery writer and, apart from [[William Shakespeare]], is the all-time best-selling author of any genre. Her books have sold over two billion copies in the [[English language]] and another billion in over 45 foreign languages (as of 2003). As an example of her broad appeal, she is the all-time best-selling author in France, with over 40 million copies sold in [[French language|French]] (as of 2003) versus 22 million for [[Émile Zola]], the nearest contender. She is famously known as the 'Queen of Crime' and is, arguably, the most important and innovative writer in the development of the English mystery novel.

Her [[Play|stage play]] ''[[The Mousetrap]]'' holds the record for the longest run ever in London, opening at the Ambassadors Theatre on [[November 25]], [[1952]], and as of 2006 is still running after more than 20,000 performances.

Christie published over eighty novels and stageplays, mainly [[Whodunit|whodunnit]]s and [[locked room mystery|locked room mysteries]], many of these featuring one of her main series characters, [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]]. Although she delighted in twisting the established [[detective fiction]] form - one of her early books, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', is renowned for its surprise denouement - she was scrupulous in &quot;playing fair&quot; with the reader by making sure information for solving the [[puzzle]] was given. 

Most of her books and [[short story|short stories]] have been filmed, some many times over (''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'', ''[[4.50 From Paddington|4.50 from Paddington]]''). The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] has produced television and radio versions of most of the Poirot and Marple stories. A later series of Poirot dramatizations starring [[David Suchet]] was made by [[Granada Television]]. In 2004, the Japanese broadcasting company [[NHK|Nippon Housou Kyoukai]] turned Poirot and Marple into animated characters in the [[anime]] series ''[[Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple]]'', introducing Mabel West (daughter of Miss Marple's mystery-writer nephew Raymond West, a [[canon (fiction)|canon]]ical Christie character) and her duck Oliver as new characters.

==Biography==
[[Image:Agatha Christie plaque, Torre Abbey.jpg|thumb|A plaque from the Agatha Christie Mile at [[Torre Abbey]] in [[Torquay]].]]

Christened '''Agatha May Clarissa Miller''', in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], [[England]], she was the daughter of a [[United States]]-born father and a British mother. (However, she never held U.S. citizenship.)

Christie's first marriage, an unhappy one, was in 1914 to Colonel Archibald Christie, an aviator in the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. The couple had one daughter, [[Rosalind Hicks]], and divorced in 1928. 

During [[World War I]] she worked at a hospital and then a pharmacy, a job that also influenced her work: many of the murders in her books are carried out with [[poison]].

In December 1926 she disappeared for eleven days, causing quite a storm in the press. Her car was found abandoned in a chalk pit. She was eventually found staying at a hotel in [[Harrogate]], where she claimed to have suffered [[amnesia]] due to a [[nervous breakdown]] following the death of her mother and her husband's confessed infidelity. Opinions are still divided as to whether this was a [[publicity stunt]] or not. A 1979 film, ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Christie, recounted a fictionalised version of the disappearance.

In 1930, Christie married (despite her divorce) a Roman Catholic, Sir [[Max Mallowan]], a British [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] 14 years her junior, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the [[Middle East]]. Other novels (such as [[And Then There Were None]]) were set in and around [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], where she was born. 

In 1971 she was granted the title of [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the British Empire]].

Agatha Christie died on [[January 12]], [[1976]], at age 85 from natural causes, at [[Winterbrook House]], [[Cholsey]] near [[Wallingford]], [[Oxfordshire]]. She is buried at St. Mary's Churchyard in Cholsey, Oxon. 

Christie's only child, [[Rosalind Hicks]], died on [[October 28]], [[2004]], also aged 85, from natural causes. Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard, now owns the royalties to his grandmother's works.

{{spoiler}}

Two of her novels were written at the height of her career but held back until after her death: they were the last cases of Poirot and Miss Marple. In the final Poirot novel ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'', Christie killed her creation and explained in her diary that she had always found him insufferable. She had a great fondness for Miss Marple, who was based largely on Christie's own grandmother, so she allowed Miss Marple to solve one more mystery in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' and return to the solitude of her village. However, since ''Sleeping Murder'' had been written quite a while previously, at least one character (Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Jane Marple's friend, Dolly) who had been declared deceased in earlier-released mysteries reappeared alive and well.

'''''The Plague''''' (''[[French language|fr]].'' '''''La Peste''''') is a [[novel]] by [[Albert Camus]], published in [[1947]], that tells the story of medical workers finding solidarity in their labor as the [[Algeria|Algerian]] city of [[Oran]] is swept by a [[pandemic|plague]]. It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition. The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace.

{{spoiler}}

Generally taken as a metaphoric treatment of the [[French resistance]] to [[Nazi]] occupation during [[World War II]], ''The Plague'' is interpreted to mean much more. Camus uses extreme hardships (e.g., pain, suffering, and death) to represent our human world. The story is told through the narrative of the main character, Dr. Rieux, whose decidedly existential account of events in the story is not only helpful in exploring the philosophy of existentialism, but also in making this a metaphor of the nature of life and suffering. Although his approach in the book is severe, he emphasizes the ideas that we ultimately have no control, irrationality of life is inevitable, and he further illustrates the human reaction towards the ‘absurd’. ''The Plague'' represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]], a theory which Camus himself helped to define.

==Main Characters==
*Dr. Bernard Rieux
*Jean Tarrou -- a man vacationing in Oran
*Raymond Rambert -- visiting journalist
*Cottard -- a fugitive
*Joseph Grand -- municipal worker who desires to be an author
*Father Paneloux -- a priest

==Minor Characters==
*Brakeley
*Castel
*Mme. Rieux
*M. Othon and his family
*The old man (Cat-spitting guy) 
*Asthma patient

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Applied ethics''' takes a theory of [[ethics]], such as [[utilitarianism]], [[social contract theory]], or [[deontology]], and applies its major principles to a particular set of circumstances and practices.  Typical examples include applied fields such as [[medical ethics]], [[legal ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[computer ethics]], [[corporate social responsibility]], or [[business ethics]]. Many considerations of applied ethics also come into play in [[human rights]] discussions.

The chief difficulty with formal, applied ethics is the potential for disagreement over what constitutes the proper theory or principles to apply, which is bound to result in solutions to specific problems that are not universally acceptable to all participants.  For example, a strict deontological approach would never permit us to deceive a patient about his condition, whereas a utilitarian approach would have us consider the consequences of doing so.  A deontologist will often come up with a very different solution than would a utilitarian, given the same facts.  

One modern approach attempting to address this is [[casuistry]].  Casuistry attempts to establish a plan of action to respond to particular facts - a form of [[case-based reasoning]].  By doing so in advance of actual investigation of the facts, it can reduce influence of interest groups.  By focusing on action and not the rationale, it increases the possibility of agreement between prior bodies of precedent and explicit moral codes. 

==List of subfields of applied ethics==

* [[Medical ethics]] / [[bioethics]]
* [[Business ethics]]
* [[Environmental ethics]] (e.g. [[global warming]])
* [[Human rights]] issues (e.g. [[gender ethics]] / [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[death penalty]])
* [[Animal rights]] issues
* [[Legal ethics]]
* [[Computer ethics]]
* [[Media ethics]] / [[journalism ethics]]
* [[Research ethics]]
* Education ethics
* Sports ethics
* Military ethics
* International ethics (e.g. [[world hunger]])

Photo from [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] Photo Archives.]]
'''Adolf Otto Eichmann''' ([[March 19]], [[1906]] &amp;ndash; [[June 1]], [[1962]]), born '''Karl Adolf Eichmann''', was a high-ranking official in [[Nazi Germany]] and served as an ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' in the [[Schutzstaffel|S.S.]] He was largely responsible for the logistics of the extermination of millions of people during [[the Holocaust]], in particular [[Jew]]s, which was called the &quot;[[final solution]]&quot; (''Endlösung''). He organized the identification and transportation of people to the various [[concentration camp]]s.  Therefore, he is often referred to as the 'Chief Executioner' of the [[Third Reich]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Solingen]], [[Germany]], Adolf Eichmann was the son of a moderately successful businessman and industrialist. In 1914, his family moved to [[Linz]], [[Austria]], and during the [[World War I|First World War]], Eichmann's father served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].  At the war's conclusion, Eichmann's father returned to the family business in Linz.  In 1920, Eichmann's family moved to Germany.

==Pre-Nazi years==
[[Image:YoungEichmann.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Adolf Eichmann in 1932]]

When Eichmann came of age in 1925, he returned to Austria to study mechanical engineering. Being a poor student, however, he soon dropped out of college. Eichmann then tried to follow in his father's footsteps in business, working as a travelling salesman which brought him back to Germany in 1930. 

Eichmann's first contact with the [[Nazi Party]] was when he joined the [[Wandervogel]] movement, which has been described as &quot;a peasant Aryan brotherhood based on Anti-Semitic ideals&quot;.  There is evidence, however, that some of the ''Wandervogel'' groups had Jewish members, and anti-Semitism may have existed in only some parts of the movement.  In 1932, Eichmann returned again to Austria and formally joined the Austrian Nazi Party at the age of twenty-six.

==Nazi Party and the SS==
[[Image:SSEichmann.jpg|thumb|125px|SS-[[Scharführer]] Adolf Eichmann in 1933]]

On the advice of old family friend [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], enlisting on [[April 1]] [[1932]], as an ''SS-[[Anwärter]]''.  He was accepted as a full SS member that November, appointed an ''SS-[[Mann (military rank)|Mann]]'', and assigned the SS number 45326. 

For the next year, Eichmann was a member of the part time [[Allgemeine-SS]] and served in a mustering formation operating from Salzburg. 

In 1933 when the Nazis came to power in Germany, Eichmann returned to that country and submitted an application to join the full time SS. This was accepted, and in November of 1933, Eichmann was promoted to ''[[Scharführer]]'' and assigned to the administrative staff of the [[Dachau concentration camp]].   

By 1934, Eichmann had chosen to make the SS a career and requested transfer into the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police) which had, by that time, become a very powerful and feared organization. Eichmann's transfer was granted in November of 1934, as he was promoted to the rank of ''[[Oberscharführer]]'' and assigned to the headquarters of the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in Berlin. Eichmann became a model administrator in the SD and quickly became noticed by his superiors.  He was promoted to ''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' in 1935 and, in 1937, commissioned as an ''SS-[[Untersturmführer]]''.

In 1937 Eichmann was sent to [[British mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] with his superior [[Herbert Hagen]] to assess the possibilities of massive Jewish emigration from Germany to Palestine. They landed in [[Haifa]] but could only obtain a transit visa so they went on to [[Cairo]]. In Cairo they met [[Feival Polkes]], an agent of the [[Haganah]], who discussed with them the plans of the Zionists and tried to enlist their assistance in facilitating Jewish emigration from Europe. According to an  answer Eichmann gave at his trial, he had also planned to meet Arab leaders in Palestine; this never happened because entry to Palestine was refused by the British authorities. Afterwards Eichmann and Hagen wrote a report recommending against large-scale emigration to Palestine for economic reasons and because it contradicted the German policy of preventing the establishment of a Jewish state there. This episode is sometimes seen as an important step towards the Nazi abandonment of emigration as the preferred &quot;solution to the Jewish problem&quot;. 

In 1938, Eichmann was assigned to Austria to help organize SS Security Forces in Vienna after the [[Anschluss]] of Austria into Germany. Through this effort, Eichmann was promoted to ''SS-[[Obersturmführer]]'', and by the end of 1938, Adolf Eichmann had been selected by the SS leadership to form the [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]], which was in charge of forcibly deporting and expelling Jews from Austria.  Through this work, Eichmann became a student of Judaism, finding the religion fascinating while also developing deep [[Anti-Semitic]] values and a hatred of the Jewish faith.

==World War II==
[[Image:Eichmann1942.jpg|right|thumb|145px|Adolf Eichmann in 1942]]

At the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Eichmann had been promoted to ''SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' and had made a name for himself with his Office for Jewish Emigration.  Through this work Eichmann made several contacts in the [[Zionist]] movement which he worked with to speed up Jewish Emigration from the Reich. 

Eichmann returned to Berlin in 1939 after the formation of the Reich Central Security Office ([[RSHA]]).  In December 1939, he was assigned to head ''RSHA Referat IV D4'', the RSHA department that dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation.  In August 1940, he released his ''[[Madagascar Plan|Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt]]'' (Reich Central Security Office: Madagascar Project), a plan for forced Jewish deportation that never materialized.  He was promoted to the rank of ''SS-[[Sturmbannführer]]'' in late [[1940]], and less than a year later to ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]''.

In 1942, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] invited Eichmann to attend the [[Wannsee Conference]] where Germany's anti-Jewish measures were set down into an official policy of [[genocide]]. To this &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish Question&quot; Eichmann was tasked as &quot;Transportation Administrator&quot;, which put him in charge of all the trains which would carry Jews to the Death Camps in [[Poland]]. For the next two years, Eichmann performed his duties with incredible zeal, often bragging that he had personally sent over five million Jews to their deaths by way of his trains. 

Eichmann's work had been noticed, and in [[1944]], he was sent to [[Hungary]] after Germany had occupied that country in fear of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion. Eichmann at once went to work deporting Jews and was able to send four hundred thousand Hungarians to their deaths in the Nazi gas chambers. 

By [[1945]], Eichmann's world was collapsing, as Reich Leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] had ordered that Jewish extermination be halted and evidence of the Final Solution be destroyed. Eichmann blatantly turned against Himmler and continued his work in Hungary against official orders. Eichmann was also working to avoid being called up in the last ditch German military effort, since a year before he had been commissioned as a Reserve ''Untersturmführer'' in the [[Waffen-SS]] and was now being ordered to active combat duty. 

Eichmann fled Hungary in 1945 as the Russians invaded, and he returned to Austria where he met up with his old friend [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]]. Kaltenbrunner, however, refused to associate with Eichmann since Eichmann's duties as an extermination administrator had left him a marked man by the Allies.

==Post World War II==
At the end of World War II, Eichmann was captured by the US Army, who did not know that this man who presented himself as &quot;Otto Eckmann&quot; was in fact a much bigger fish.  Early in 1946, he escaped from US custody and hid in various parts of Germany for a few years.  In 1948 he obtained a landing permit for [[Argentina]], but did not seek to use it immediately.  At the beginning of 1950, Eichmann went to [[Italy]], where he posed as a refugee named Ricardo Klement.  With the help of a Franciscan monk who had connections with archbishop [[Alois Hudal]], Eichmann obtained an [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] humanitarian passport and an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] visa.  He arrived by ship in Argentina on [[July 14]],  [[1950]].  For the next ten years, he worked in several odd jobs in the [[Buenos Aires]] area (from factory foreman, to junior water engineer and professional rabbit farmer). Eichmann also brought his family to Argentina. Argentina at the time was a haven for many Nazis.

==Capture==
[[Image:Adold Eichmann.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adolf Eichmann during his 1961 trial in Jerusalem.]]
Throughout the 1950s many Jews and other victims of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazi [[war crimes|war criminals]]. Among them was [[Nazi hunter]] [[Simon Wiesenthal]]. In 1954, Wiesenthal's suspicions that Eichmann was in Argentina were sparked upon receiving a postcard from an associate who had moved to [[Buenos Aires]]. &quot;I saw that dirty pig Eichmann,&quot; the letter read in part, &quot;He lives near Buenos Aires and works for a water company&quot;. With this (and other) information collected by Wiesenthal, the [[Israel]]is had solid leads regarding Eichmann's whereabouts. [[Isser Harel]], the then-head of [[Mossad]] (Israeli intelligence agency), later claimed in an unpublished manuscript that Wiesenthal &quot;'had no role whatsoever' in Eichmann's apprehension but in fact had endangered the entire Eichmann operation and aborted the planned capture of Auschwitz doctor [[Josef Mengele]].&quot; (Schachter, Jonathan &quot;Isser Harel Takes On Nazi-Hunter. Wiesenthal 'Had No Role' In Eichmann Kidnapping.&quot; The Jerusalem Post [[7 May]] [[1991]])

Also instrumental in exposing Eichmann's identity was [[Lothar Hermann]], a worker of Jewish descent who fled to Argentina from Germany following his incarceration in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], where Eichmann had served as an administrator. By the 1950s, Hermann had settled into life in Buenos Aires with his family; daughter Sylvia became acquainted with the Eichmann family and romantically involved with Klaus, the oldest Eichmann son. Due to Klaus's boastful remarks about his father's life as a Nazi and direct responsibility for the [[Holocaust]], Hermann knew he had struck gold in 1957 after reading a newspaper report about German war criminals - of which Eichmann was one. Soon after, he sent Sylvia to the Eichmanns' home on a fact-finding mission. She was met at the door by Eichmann himself, and after unsuccessfully asking for Klaus, she inquired as to whether she was speaking to his father. Eichmann confirmed this fact. Excited, Hermann soon began a correspondence with [[Fritz Bauer]], chief [[prosecutor]] for the [[West Germany|West German]] state of [[Hesse]], and provided details about Eichmann's person and life. Bauer knew that Germany, served by former employees of the Nazi regime, would do little to serve justice to Eichmann. He contacted Israeli officials, who worked closely with Hermann over the next several years to learn about Eichmann and to formulate a plan to capture him.

In 1960, the [[Mossad]] discovered that Eichmann was in [[Argentina]] and began an effort to locate his exact whereabouts when, through relentless surveillance, it was confirmed that Ricardo Klement was, in fact, Adolf Eichmann. The Israeli government then approved an operation to capture Eichmann and bring him to [[Jerusalem]] for trial as a war criminal. He was captured by a team of Mossad agents on [[May 11]], [[1960]], as part of a [[covert operation]]. He was flown aboard an [[El Al]] airliner from Argentina to [[Israel]] on [[May 21]], [[1960]]. 

For some time the Israeli government denied involvement in Eichmann's capture, claiming that he had been taken by Jewish volunteers. Eventually, however, the pretense was dropped, and then prime minister [[David Ben Gurion]] announced Eichmann's capture to the [[Knesset]] (Israel's national legislature) on [[May 23]] [[1960]], receiving a standing ovation in return. [[Isser Harel]], head of the Mossad at the time of the operation, wrote a book about Eichmann's capture entitled ''The House on Garibaldi Street''; some years later a member of the capture team, [[Peter Malkin]], authored ''Eichmann in my Hands'', a book that contains fascinating insights into Eichmann's character and motivations, but whose veracity has been attacked.

==Trial==
[[Image:Eichmann_trial_1961_in_glass_box.jpg|right|thumb|Eichmann and a bulletproof glass booth during the open trial.]]

Eichmann's trial in front of an Israeli court in [[Jerusalem]] started on [[April 11]], [[1961]]. He was indicted on 15 criminal charges, including charges of [[crimes against humanity]], crimes against the Jewish people and membership of an outlawed organization. As in Israeli criminal procedure, his trial was presided over by three judges. [[Gideon Hausner]], the Israeli attorney general, personally acted as chief prosecutor. 

The trial caused huge international controversy as well as an international sensation. The Israeli government allowed news programs all over the world to broadcast the trial live with few restrictions. [[Television]] viewers saw a nondescript man sitting in a [[bulletproof glass]] booth while witnesses, including many [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors, testified against him and his role in transporting victims to the extermination camps. During the whole trial, Eichmann insisted that he was only &quot;following orders&quot; - the same defense used by the Nazi war criminals during the 1945-1946 [[Nuremberg Trials]]. He explicitly declared that he had abdicated his [[consciousness]] in order to follow the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. This defense in turn promoted the [[Milgram experiment]]. 

After 14 weeks of testimony with more than 1,500 documents, 100 prosecution witnesses (90 of whom were Nazi concentration camp survivors) and dozens of defense depositions delivered by diplomatic couriers from 16 different countries, the Eichmann trial ended on [[August 14]], [[1961]] where the judges were then left to deliberate. On [[December 11]] the three judges announced their verdict where Eichmann was convicted on all counts. He was then sentenced to death on [[December 15]], [[1961]]. Eichmann appealed the verdict, mostly relying on legal arguments about Israel's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which he was charged.  He also claimed that he was protected by the principle of &quot;Acts of State&quot; and repeated his &quot;superior orders&quot; defence. On [[May 29]], [[1962]] Israel's Supreme Court, sitting as a Court of Criminal Appeal, rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court's judgment on all counts. On [[May 31]], Israeli president [[Itzhak Ben-Zvi]] turned down Eichmann's petition for mercy. Eichmann was [[hanging|hanged]] a few minutes after midnight on [[ June 1]], [[1962]], at [[Ramla]] prison, officially the only civil [[execution (legal)|execution]] ever carried out in [[Israel]]. Eichmann allegedly refused a last meal, preferring instead a bottle of [[Carmel]], a dry red Israeli wine of which he consumed about half of the bottle. He also refused to don the traditional black hood for his execution.

His last words were, reportedly, &quot;Long live Germany. Long live Austria. Long live Argentina. These are the countries with which I have been most closely associated and I shall not forget them. I had to obey the rules of war and my flag. I am ready.&quot;{{fact}}

His body was cremated and ashes scattered at sea the very next morning, so that no nation would serve as Adolf Eichmann's final resting place.

==Eichmann analysis==
In the 40 years since Eichmann's death, historians have speculated on certain facts regarding his life. The most important question is how responsible Eichmann was for the implementation of [[the Holocaust]].  Most agree that Eichmann knew exactly what he was doing; however, some &quot;Eichmann Defenders&quot; (his son included) state that he was unfairly judged and that he was only doing his duty as a German soldier.  

A third - and highly controversial - analysis came from political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]], a Jew who fled Germany before Hitler's rise, and who reported on Eichmann's trial for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. In ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'', a book formed by this reporting, Arendt concluded that, aside from a desire for improving his career, Eichmann showed no trace of [[anti-Semitism]] or [[psychological]] damage. She called him the embodiment of the &quot;banality of [[evil]],&quot; as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred. She suggested that this most strikingly discredits the idea that the Nazi criminals were manifestly [[psychopath]]ic and different from ordinary people. (Many concluded from this and similar observations that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the right situation, and given the correct incentives, but Arendt disagreed with this interpretation.)

Eichmann's involvement with the SS Underground Group [[ODESSA]] is also a mystery, as there is evidence that Eichmann had contact with the group but did not actively participate in ODESSA activities.  Rumours also abound as to whether or not Eichmann personally knew [[Josef Mengele]] and whether or not the two [[war crimes|war criminals]] ever worked together in South America.  Mossad was convinced that Eichmann was a contact for Mengele and had planned to conduct a dual-capture operation in 1961 had Eichmann revealed Mengele's whereabouts.

A footnote to Eichmann's SS career focuses on the point as to why he was never promoted to the rank of full SS-Colonel, known as ''[[Standartenführer]]''.  With Eichmann's record and responsibilities, he would have been a prime candidate for advancement, yet after 1941, his SS record contains no evidence that he was ever even recommended for another promotion.  Many have speculated that [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] may have seen Eichmann as a dangerous man, rising through the SS ranks, and had curbed his SS career to prevent Eichmann from becoming too powerful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' (or '''modulus'''&lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Argand&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Argand|1]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) of a [[real number]] is its numerical value without regard to its [[sign]]. So, for example, 3 is the absolute value of both 3 and &amp;minus;3.  In computers, the [[mathematical function]] used to perform this calculation is usually given the name '''abs()'''.

Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s and [[vector space]]s.

The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.

[[Image:Absolute value.png|frame|The graph of the absolute value function for real numbers.]] 

==Real numbers==

For any [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Wolfram&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Wolfram|2]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;|a|,&lt;/math&gt; and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|a| := \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0 (number)|zero]], never [[negative and non-negative numbers|negative]].

From a geometric point of view, the absolute value of a real number is the [[distance]] along the [[real number line]] of that number from zero, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of the properties of the absolute value (see [[#Distance|&quot;Distance&quot;]] below).

The following proposition, gives an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] which is sometimes used as an alternative (and equivalent) definition of the absolute value:

'''PROPOSITION 1''':
:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties:

'''PROPOSITION 2''':
:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a||b|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Multiplicativeness]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a+b|  \le |a| + |b|  &lt;/math&gt;
|[[Subadditivity]]
|}

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

'''PROPOSITION 3''':
:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|-a| = |a|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|[[Symmetry]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles (equivalent to positive-definiteness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b|  \le |a - c| +|c - b|  &lt;/math&gt;
|[[Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a/b| = |a| / |b| \mbox{ (if } b \ne 0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a-b| \ge |a| - |b| &lt;/math&gt;
|(equivalent to subadditivity)
|}

Two other useful inequalities are: 
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

The above are often used in solving inequalities; for example:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x-3| \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -6 \le x \le 12 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Complex numbers ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px&quot; title=&quot;Graphic Representation&quot;&gt;
[[image:complex.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Since the [[complex number]]s are not [[ordered set|ordered]], the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the identity given in Proposition 1:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
can be seen as motivating the following definition.

For any [[complex number]]

:&lt;math&gt;z = x + iy\,&lt;/math&gt;

the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;|z|,&lt;/math&gt; and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|z| :=  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the absolute value of a real number ''x'' is equal to its absolute value considered as a complex number since:

:&lt;math&gt; |x + i0| = \sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the geometric interpretation of the absolute value for real numbers, it follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] that the absolute value of a complex number is the distance in the [[complex plane]] of that complex number from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], and more generally, that the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.

The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in Propositions 2 and 3 above. In addition, If

:&lt;math&gt; z = x + \mathrm{i}y = r (\cos \phi + \mathrm{i}\sin \phi ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{z} = x - iy&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then it is easily seen that

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = r\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|z|=|\bar{z}|&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Absolute value functions==
The real absolute value function is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere. It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for ''x'' = 0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;(-&amp;infin;, 0]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] on the interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[0, &amp;infin;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[invertible]].

The [[complex number|complex]] absolute value function is continuous everywhere but differentiable ''nowhere'' (One way to see this is to show that it does not obey the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]]).

Both the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].

==Ordered rings==
The definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can easily be extended to any [[ordered ring]]. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an element of an ordered ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''absolute value''' of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;|a| &lt;/math&gt;, is defined to be:

:&lt;math&gt;|a| := \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0, \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[additive inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the additive [[identity element]].

== Distance==
The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.

The standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points

:&lt;math&gt;a = (a_1, a_2, \cdots , a_n) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = (b_1, b_2, \cdots , b_n) &lt;/math&gt;

in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen to be a generalization of &lt;math&gt;|a - b|,&lt;/math&gt; since if &lt;math&gt;a,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;b &lt;/math&gt; are real, then by Proposition 1,
:&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

while if 

:&lt;math&gt; a = a_1 + i a_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; b = b_1 + i b_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

are complex numbers, then

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above shows that the &quot;absolute value&quot; distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.

The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given in Propositions 2 and 3 above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:

A real valued function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''distance function''' (or a '''metric''') for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
|Identity of indiscernibles
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = d(b, a) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Symmetry
|-
|&lt;math&gt;d(a+b)  \le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Triangle inequality
|}

==Fields==
The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in Proposition 2 above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.

A real-valued function &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; on a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''absolute value''' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'') if it satisfies the following four axioms:

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a) = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Multiplicativeness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v(a+b)  \le v(a) + v(b)  &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality
|}

It follows from the above that &lt;math&gt;v(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the multiplicative [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is an absolute value on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;F \times F&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;d(a, b) = v(a - b) &lt;/math&gt;, is a metric, and if &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is the multiplicative identity in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the following are equivalent:

* &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality &lt;math&gt; d(x, y) \le \mathrm{max}\{d(x, z), d(y, z)\}. &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; \big\{ v\Big(\sum_{k=1}^n e\Big) : n \in \mathbb{N} \big\} &lt;/math&gt; is [[bounded set|bounded]] in '''R'''.

* &lt;math&gt;  v\Big(\sum_{k=1}^n e\Big) \le 1&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;  n \in \mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; v(a + b) \le \mathrm{max}\{v(a), v(b)\} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; a, b \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].&lt;sup id=&quot;ref_Schechter&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnote_Schechter|3]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

== Vector spaces  ==

Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers, can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.

A real valued function ||&amp;middot;|| on a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, is called an '''absolute value''' (or more usually a '''[[norm (mathematics)|norm]]''') if it satisfies the following axioms:

For all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;,

:{| cellpadding=10
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\|  \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
|Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v}\| = 0 \iff \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|a \mathbf{v}\| = |a| \|\mathbf{v}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\| \le \|\mathbf{v}\| + \|\mathbf{u}\| &lt;/math&gt;
|Subadditivity or triangle inequality
|}

The norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.

In the case of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the function

:&lt;math&gt;\|(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n) \| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers '''R''' are considered as the one-dimensional [[vector space]] [[Euclidean space|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Examples|''p''-norm]] for any ''p''. In fact the absolute value is the &quot;only&quot; norm in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense that, for every norm ||&amp;middot;|| in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ||''x''||=||1||&amp;middot;|''x''|. The complex absolute value is a special case of the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Algorithms ==

In the [[C programming language]], the &lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;labs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;llabs()&lt;/code&gt; (in C99), &lt;code&gt;fabs()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fabsf()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;fabsl()&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the absolute value of an operand. Coding the integer version of the function is trivial, ignoring the boundary case where the largest negative integer is input:

 int abs(int i)
 {
     if (i &lt; 0)
         return -i;
     else
         return i;
 }

The [[floating-point]] versions are trickier, as they have to contend with special codes for [[infinity]] and [[not-a-number]]s.

Using [[assembly language]], it is possible to take the absolute value of a [[processor register|register]] in just three instructions (example shown for a 32-bit register on an [[x86]] architecture, [[Intel]] syntax):

 cdq
 xor eax, edx
 sub eax, edx

&lt;code&gt;cdq&lt;/code&gt; extends the sign bit of &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt;.  If &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is nonnegative, then &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; becomes zero, and the latter two instructions have no effect, leaving &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; unchanged.  If &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is negative, then &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; becomes 0xFFFFFFFF, or -1.  The next two instructions then become a [[two's complement]] inversion, giving the absolute value of the negative value in &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Arches National Park''' preserves over 2,000 [[natural arch|natural sandstone arches]], including the world-famous [[Delicate Arch]], in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations.

The park is located near [[Moab, Utah]], and is 119 square miles ([[1 E8 m²|309 km²]]) in size.  Its highest elevation is 5,653 feet (1,723 m) at Elephant Butte and its lowest elevation is 4,085 feet (1,245 m) at the [[visitor center]].  It receives 10 inches (250 mm) of rain a year on average.

The area, administered by the [[National Park Service]], was originally designated as a [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]] on [[April 12]], [[1929]]. It was redesignated a [[U.S. National Park|national park]] on [[November 12]], [[1971]].  More than 730,000 people visited it in 2004.

==Features==
[[Image:North_&amp;_South_Window_Arches_1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|North Window and South Window Arches]]
Among the notable features of the park are:
* [[Delicate Arch]], a lone-standing arch which has become a symbol of Utah
* [[Balanced Rock]], a large balancing rock
* [[Double Arch]], two arches located close to each other
* [[Landscape Arch]], a very thin, long arch over 300 feet (100 m), the largest in the park
* [[Fiery Furnace (park)|Fiery Furnace]], an area of maze-like narrow passages and tall rock columns
* [[Devil's Garden]], with many arches and columns scattered along a ridge
* [[Dark Angel (park)|Dark Angel]], a free-standing column of dark stone at the end of the Devil's Garden trail  
* [[Courthouse Towers]], a collection of tall columns
* [[Petrified dunes]], petrified remnants of [[sand dunes]] blown from the ancient lakes that covered the area

==Geology==
[[Image:Delicate arch 3d.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Delicate Arch, one of the most famous arches in the park. (USGS){{3d_glasses}}]]
The national park lies atop an underground salt bed, which is basically responsible for the arches and spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. Thousands of feet thick in places, this salt bed was deposited over the [[Colorado Plateau]] some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with residue from floods and winds and the oceans that came in intervals. Much of this debris was compressed into rock. At one time this overlying earth may have been one mile thick.

Salt under pressure is unstable, and the salt bed below Arches was no match for the weight of this thick cover of rock. Under such pressure it shifted, buckled, liquefied, and repositioned itself, thrusting the Earth layers upward into domes. Whole sections dropped into cavities. In places they turned almost on edge. [[Geologic fault|Faults]] occurred. The result of one such 2,500-foot displacement, the [[Moab Fault]], is seen from the visitor center.

As this subsurface movement of salt shaped the Earth, surface erosion stripped away the younger rock layers. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored [[Entrada Sandstone]], in which most of the arches form, and the buff-colored [[Navajo Sandstone]]. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time water seeped into the superficial cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches. This is the geologic story of Arches - probably. The evidence is largely circumstantial.

==History==
[[Image:Turret_Arch_1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Turret Arch]]
Humans have occupied the region since the last [[ice age]] 10,000 years ago.  [[Fremont people]] and [[Ancient Pueblo People]] lived in the area up until about 700 years ago.  Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paitue tribes in the area when they first came through in [[1775]], but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the [[Mormon]] [[Elk Mountain Mission]] in [[1855]], but then soon abandoned the area.  Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring riverine valley in the 1880s.  Word of the beauty in the surrounding [[rock formations]] spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.

The Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]]. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[prospector]] living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the &quot;Devil's Garden&quot; (known today as the &quot;Klondike Bluffs&quot;). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.

The following year additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence M. Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student studying the geology of the nearby La Sal mountains, who was shown the scenic area by retired local physician Dr. J.W. &quot;Doc&quot; Williams.

[[image:Landscape arch 20030917 093317 1.1504x807.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Landscape Arch]]

A succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process the name &quot;Devil's Garden&quot; was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley, and Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as &quot;The Windows&quot;, was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service from [[1926]], but was resisted by President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s Interior Secretary. Finally in April [[1929]], shortly after his inauguration, President [[Herbert Hoover]] signed a presidential proclamation creating Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]] was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name &quot;Arches&quot; was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.

In late [[1938]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed a proclamation which enlarged the Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in [[1960]] to accommodate a new road alignment.

In early [[1969]], just before leaving office, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed a proclamation substantially enlarging the Arches. Two years later President [[Richard Nixon]] signed legislation enacted by Congress which significantly reduced the area of Arches, but changed its status to a National Park.

==Publicity==
American writer [[Edward Abbey]] was a [[park ranger]] at Arches National Monument when he kept journals that became his book ''Desert Solitaire''.  The success of this book, as well as the rise in [[adventure tourism|adventure-based recreation]], has drawn many [[hikers]], [[mountain bike|mountain-bikers]], and [[off-road]] enthusiasts to the area, but activities are limited within park boundaries: camping, foot hiking (along designated trails), and driving only along marked roads.

The opening scenes of the movie ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' were filmed at the park.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''analog''' or '''analogue''' signal is any variable signal [[continuous function|continuous]] in both time and amplitude. It differs from a [[digital signal]] in that small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful. Analog is usually thought of in an [[electricity|electrical]] context, however mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and other systems may also use analog signals.

The word &quot;analog&quot; implies an [[analogy]] between cause and effect, voltage in and voltage out, current in and current out, sound in and frequency out.

An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. Electrically, the property most commonly used is [[voltage]] followed closely by [[frequency]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], and [[electric charge|charge]].

Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal, often such a signal is a measured [[response]] to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], [[position]], or [[pressure]], and is achieved using a [[transducer]].

For example, in an analog sound recording, the variation in [[pressure]] of a [[sound]] striking a [[microphone]] creates a corresponding variation in the voltage amplitude of a current passing through it. An increase in the volume of the sound causes the fluctuation of the current's voltage amplitude to increase while keeping the same rhythm.

The primary disadvantage of analog signalling is that any system has [[Noise (physics)|noise]]&amp;mdash;that is, random variations&amp;mdash;in it. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, these random variations become dominant. Electrically these losses are lessened by shielding, good connections, and several cable types such as coax and twisted pair.

The effects of [[signal noise|noise]] make signal loss and distortion impossible to recover, since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well.

Another method of conveying an analog signal is to use [[modulation]]. In this, some base signal (e.g., a [[sinusoidal]] [[carrier wave]]) has one of its properties modulated: [[amplitude modulation]] involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage [[wave]]form by the source information, [[frequency modulation]] changes the [[frequency]]. Other techniques, such as changing the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the base signal also work.

Analog circuits do not involve [[quantisation]] of information into digital format. The concept being measured over the circuit, whether sound, light, pressure, temperature, or an exceeded limit, remains from end to end.

[[Clock]]s with hands are called analog; those that display digits are called digital. However, many analog clocks are actually digital since the hands do not move in a smooth continuous motion, but in small steps every second or half a second, or every minute with a loud CLUNK.

See [[digital]] for a discussion of ''digital vs. analog''.

'''''And Then There Were None''''' (also known as '''''Ten Little Indians''''' and originally as '''''Ten Little Niggers''''') is a [[detective fiction|detective novel]] by [[Agatha Christie]] first published in [[1939]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}

The story focuses on ten strangers who are all (but one) brought, by misleading information, to an [[Burgh Island|island]] off the coast of [[Devon]], in southern [[England]].

The characters are:
*Vera Claythorne, a young teacher in a third class school
*Philip Lombard, a down-on-his luck explorer/mercenary
*William Blore, a retired police inspector, now a private investigator
*Dr. Edward Armstrong, a private physician
*Justice Lawrence Wargrave, a bitter, cynical retired judge
*Emily Brent, an elderly spinster and a religious zealot of extreme proportions
*Rogers, the butler
*General Macarthur, a lonely, retired army man
*Mrs. Rogers, the housekeeper, Rogers' wife
*Anthony Marston, a reckless playboy

On their first night, the ten realize that they have been brought to the island under false pretenses,  but now have no means of getting away. A mysterious gramophone recording informs them that all ten of them are guilty of &quot;murders,&quot; though in this case the killings cannot be dealt with by law.

On the first night, Anthony Marston dies of posioning. In the morning, Mrs. Rogers fails to wake up and it is determined that she probably had a fatal overdose of sleeping drugs. At lunch the next day, General Macarthur is found dead by a blow to the back of his head. After searching the island for the murderer or possible hiding spots, the survivors realize that the murderer can only be one of them, and whoever it is, is playing a game - killing them in manners poetically similar to a nursery rhyme, and also removing one of ten little figurines in the dining room after each death. The survivors have a meeting and discover that none of them have an alibi for any of the deaths.

The next morning Rogers is found dead in the woodshed, having been killed with a giant axe that was nearby. Later that day, Emily Brent dies from an injection of [[potassium cyanide]]. The five remaining - Dr. Armstrong, Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard, Vera Claythorne, and Inspector Blore - become increasingly paranoid. Later, Justice Wargrave is found dead, having been shot through the head. That night, Dr. Armostrong leaves the house, and when the rest of the survivors search for him they cannot find him.

Vera, Inspector Blore, and Philip Lombard go outside. Blore decides to go back to the house to get some sustinance, and a dull thud is heard. When Vera and Philip check to see what happened, they find Blore crushed to death by a heavy marble clock. They assume Doctor Armstrong did it and decide to stay out of the house. The two survivors get back to the beach only to find Armstrong's body washed up on the shore. Vera and Lombard they realise that they are the only two left. Even though they could not possibly have mudered the Inspector, the never ending suspicion has driven them to a breaking point and they assume each other as the murderers. Philip Lombard reaches for he revolver, only to discover that Vera Claythorne pickpoketed it. She shoots him and then returns to the house, thinking she is finally safe. When Vera gets to her room, she discovers a noose hanging there, and having been finally driven crazy by the entire experience, she hangs herself, thus fullfilling the rhyme upon which the murders were based.

So, by the novel's end, all ten guests are dead, leaving a &quot;[[locked room mystery]].&quot; A police investigation, though thorough, cannot find any satisfactory explanation. It is resolved when a letter in a bottle, tossed into the ocean and recovered by a trawler, is delivered to the police, which was written by the murderer.

==Film and Theater==

Christie had been disappointed in previous adaptations of her novels. As she had written a play before, she decided to adapt her own book herself. She decided that the staging of a play required the survival of two characters in order to carry the plot exposition. Consequently the resolution of the play is very different from that of the book (though the identity of the killer remains the same). This stage version dates from [[1943]]. All but one of the films followed the play's humourous tone &amp; ending, rather than the book's dark tone and downbeat resolution.  

The story was adapted for the cinema as ''And Then There Were None'' in [[1945]] and again in [[1974]]; and also filmed as ''Ten Little Indians'' in [[1959]] (as truncated television recording of the play), [[1965]], [[1974]], [[1989]] and as ''Ten Little Niggers'' in [[1987]]. The 1945 &amp; 1987 film versions were the most successful and took fewer liberties with Christie's plot than some of the other versions.  The 1945 film was [[film director|directed]] by [[Rene Clair]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Dudley Nichols]]. The 1987 film was written, produced and directed by renowed [[Russia|Russian]] [[filmmaker]], [[Stanislav Govorukhin]].

The 1987 version was an extremely faithful-to-the-novel film adaptation made in [[Russia]], the title of which (''&quot;Desyat Negrityat&quot;'') translates directly to the novel's original title, ''Ten Little Niggers'' (since the novel's title was never altered in most of the world outside of [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].) The Russian version is the only adaptation that didn't change any of the characters or the ending of the book. It is most famous in Russia for having a legendary ensemble cast of the most famous and talented actors in Russia. Arguably, the Russian production is even more star-studded than any of the [[Hollywood]] versions.

These film versions usually feature all-star casts and are set in different locations, such as the [[Austria|Austrian]] [[Alps]], the [[Iran|Iranian]] desert, and the [[Africa|African]] jungle. The only ones to keep the island as the location were the [[1945]] and the [[1987]] versions.

The basic concept of the plot has been recycled countless times, often without crediting Christie (who herself recycled numerous story concepts.)  The most recent example is probably the 2004 [[crime]] [[thriller]] ''[[Mindhunters]]'', which includes many elements of Christie's original story, including an island and various plot twists.

In 2005 a new version of ''And Then There Were None'' was performed in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. Written by [[Kevin Elyot]] and directed by [[Steven Pimlott]], it is based on the novel rather than on Christie's drama.

* ''[[Ten Little Indians (1989 film)]]'' - directed by [[Alan Birkinshaw]] ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098454/ IMDb listing])

==The rhyme==
The book's original title &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot; was taken from the chorus of an [[United States|American]] [[comic song]], written by [[Septimus Winner]] in [[1868]]; there are many variants of the lyrics, of which &quot;Ten Little [[Injuns]]&quot; is probably the most familiar to modern audiences.  The song is now considered by many to be [[racist]] and offensive.

The rhyme used in the novel is as follows:

&lt;!--This needs transwiki-ing to wikisource --&gt; 
:Ten little Indian boys going out to dine; 
::One choked his little self and then there were nine. 
:Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; 
::One overslept himself and then there were eight. 
:Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon; 
::One said he'd stay and then there were seven. 
:Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; 
::One chopped himself into halves and then there were six. 
:Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; 
::A [[bumblebee]] stung one and then there were five. 
:Five little Indian boys going in for law; 
::One got in [[Chancery]] and then there were four. 
:Four little Indian boys going out to sea; 
::A [[red herring]] swallowed one and then there were three. 
:Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo; 
::A big bear hugged one and then there were two. 
:Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; 
::One got frizzled up and then there was one. 
:One little Indian boy left all alone; 
::He went and hanged himself and then there were none.

==Ten Little Indians and 'and then there was one' in Popular Culture==

The [[meme]]s 'Ten Little Indians' and 'and then there was one' have been used many times in modern days to refer to situations in stories - oftentimes [[slasher film]]s, other [[horror film]]s, and [[disaster film]]s - in which the characters die off one by one. This is how many films of those genres are structured, in order to provide gory scenes periodically, and to ultimately force the [[main character]] to face off against the [[villain]] alone. This main character in slasher films is often the '[[Final Girl]].'

==Trivia==
* &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was adapted from [[Agatha Christie]]'s book into a video game in 2005 by [[The Adventure Company | The Adventure Company]]. It was released in November of that year to mixed reviews, most of the slack going to changing the &quot;Indians&quot; to &quot;Sailors,&quot; in a case of political correctness gone awry, and altering the killer's motive &amp; identity, though it is possible to see the original novel's ending when one finishes a puzzle after completing the main game. Four further books are to be adapted.

* &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is a song by [[The Yardbirds]] along the same lines with the rhyme, although more dismal. In the song, the death of each &quot;Indian&quot; is related to breaking one of the [[Ten Commandments]].

* A Japanese [[doujin]] game, [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]], features an extra stage of a girl having the spell card named &quot;And Then Will There be None?&quot;, and a theme music named &quot;Is she the U.N.Owen?&quot;. (U.N.Owen is the killer's alias used in the novel, play, and films.)

* &quot;Zehn Kleine [[Jägermeister]]&quot; (Ten Little &quot;Jägermeister&quot;) is a song by the German band [[Die Toten Hosen]], along the same lines as the rhyme, but with funny or satirical things happening to the characters (taking drugs, being arrested for tax evasion, dying of [[Mad Cow Disease]] etc)

* Polish 2003 film [[Show (film)|Show]], starring [[Cezary Pazura]], tells the story of a reality show located on a remote island. Suddenly, the competitors start to die one after another. One of the competitors even mention Agatha Christies' novel.

'''Hercule Poirot''' (pronounced {{IPA|[ɛʀkyl pwaʀo]}}) is a [[fictional character]], the primary detective of [[Agatha Christie]]'s novels. He appears in over 30 novels and over 50 short stories and is probably one of the most famous characters ever made. 

The character was born in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], [[Belgium]], and has worked as a Belgian police officer, notably in [[Brussels]], but moved to [[England]] during [[World War I]] and started a second career as a [[private investigator|private detective]].  Poirot is remarkable for his small stature and egg-shaped head, his cat-like green eyes, his meticulous moustache, his dandified dressing habits, his absolute obsession with order and neatness, and his disdain for detective methods that include crawling on hands and knees and looking for clues.  He prefers to examine the psychology of a crime to discover more evidence, once even betting his best friend and sometime partner, [[Arthur Hastings]], that he could solve a case simply by sitting in an easy chair and using his &quot;little grey cells.&quot;

Like a large number of detectives of the early days of mystery fiction (including [[Miss Marple]], [[Sherlock Holmes (character)|Sherlock Holmes]], and [[Father Brown]]), Poirot is unmarried.  The love of his life, Countess Vera Rossakoff, appears in the short stories &quot;The Double Clue&quot; and &quot;The Capture of Cerberus&quot; and the novel ''The Big Four''.

His fictional address (from his business card) is 56B Whitehaven Mansions,
Sandhurst Square, London W1. The building used in the series can be found on Charterhouse Square - City of London.

==Major novels==

The Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England, from the first book (''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]''), where he is a refugee staying at Styles, to the last Poirot book (''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]''), where he visits Styles once again before his death.  In between, Poirot solves cases outside England as well, including his most famous case, ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934).

Hercule Poirot became famous with the publication, in [[1926]], of ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', whose surprising solution proved controversial.  The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels: [[Edmund Wilson]] alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction, &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;  Aside from ''Roger Ackroyd'', the most critically-acclaimed Poirot novels appeared from [[1932]] to [[1942]], including such acknowledged classics as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', ''[[The ABC Murders]]'' (1935), ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' (1936), and ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937).  The last of these, a tale of multiple homicide upon a Nile steamer, was judged by the celebrated detective novelist [[John Dickson Carr]] to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time.

The [[1942]] novel ''[[Five Little Pigs]]'' (aka ''Murder in Retrospect''), in which Poirot investigates a murder committed sixteen years before by analyzing various accounts of the tragedy, is a ''[[Rashomon (movie)|Rashomon]]''-like performance that critic and mystery novelist Robert Barnard called the best of the Christie novels.

==Recurring characters==

While the majority of the supporting cast in the Poirot stories is always different, some characters do show up more often.  [[Arthur Hastings]], whom Poirot met almost immediately after arriving in England, becomes his life-long partner and appears in many of the novels and stories.  Other frequently recurring characters include the detective novelist [[Ariadne Oliver]], Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature, and Poirot's secretary, Miss Lemon. [[Chief Inspector Japp]] of Scotland Yard appears in many of the stories, as well.  The mysterious [[Russia]]n Countess Vera Rossakoff, Poirot's only known love interest, appears in three stories.

==Hercule Poirot on screen and stage==
[[Image:Ustinov_is_Poirot.jpg|framed|[[Peter Ustinov]] as Poirot]]
{{sect-stub}}
Hercule Poirot has been played by several actors.  The character first appeared onscreen in [[1931]], played by [[Austin Trevor]].  Perhaps the most notable portrayals have been by [[Albert Finney]] in the cinematic version of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', and [[David Suchet]] in a long series of television productions.  The role has also been played more than once by [[Peter Ustinov]] and by [[Tony Randall]], [[Ian Holm]], and [[Alfred Molina]].

In 2004, [[NHK]] (a Japanese TV network) produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Famous Detectives Poirot and Marple]] (Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple)'', as well as a manga series by the same title released starting in 2005. The series ran from [[July 4]], [[2004]] through [[May 15]], [[2005]], and is now being shown as [[rerun]]s on NHK and other networks in Japan. Poirot was voiced by [[Kōtarō Satomi]] (Satomi Kōtarō) and Miss Marple was voiced by [[Kaoru Yachigusa]] (Yachigusa Kaoru).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Joan_Hickson_is_Miss_Marple.jpg|thumb|[[Joan Hickson]] as '''Miss Marple''']]

'''Jane Marple''', usually known as '''Miss Marple''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in many [[Agatha Christie]] novels.

She lives in the little village of [[St. Mary Mead]]. She looks like an ordinary [[spinster]], in [[Harris Tweed|tweed]] and with a curiosity as wide as the world, but when it comes to solving mysteries, she turns out to have a sharp logical mind. In the best [[detective fiction|detective story]] tradition, she often embarrasses the local &quot;professional&quot; police, usually by making an analogy with some village occurrence or character.  

==Personality==
When we first meet Jane Marple she is very much the stereotypical spinster of the last century — blue-eyed and frail, wearing a black lace cap and mittens, and constantly knitting. She is also a gleeful gossip and not especially nice. The first Marple novel, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' sees a markedly different Marple to the one who would appear in later books, as she modernized and became nicer over the years.

Miss Marple's nephew, the &quot;well-known author&quot; Raymond West and his wife Joan (who first appeared as Joyce), a modern artist, were introduced in 1933 in ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]''. Raymond, in particular, is overconfident of himself and dismissive of Miss Marple's mental powers, though she continually upstages him in the end.

''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' ([[1950]]), Agatha Christie's fiftieth novel, is regarded by some as the best Miss Marple novel, and one of the best of Christie's [[whodunit]]s.

Miss Marple is able to solve difficult crimes not only because of her shrewd intelligence, but because St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. No crime can arise without reminding Miss Marple of some parallel incident in the history of her time. 

As with her other famous detective [[Hercule Poirot]], Christie wrote a concluding novel to her Marple series, ''Sleeping Murder'', in [[1940]] and saved it for her old age, causing some embarrassing discrepancies as people who were written off as dead (such as Dolly Bantry's husband, Colonel Arthur Bantry) by the time her mystery &quot;Nemesis&quot; was published, which was the preceding Marple mystery '''but actually the last one written''', appear alive in ''Sleeping Murder'' having been resurrected from the fictional dead. ''Sleeping Murder'' was published in [[1976]], shortly after Christie's death, and was the last of her novels to be published, although, again, it was written in [[1940]].

==Books featuring Miss Marple==
* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' ([[1930]])
* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' ([[1942]])
* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' ([[1943]])
* ''[[A Murder is Announced]]'' ([[1950]])
* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]], or Murder With Mirrors'' ([[1952]])
* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' ([[1953]])
* ''[[4.50 from Paddington|4.50 from Paddington, or What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!]]'' ([[1957]])
* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' ([[1962]])
* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' ([[1964]])
* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' ([[1965]])
* ''[[Nemesis (Christie)|Nemesis]]'' ([[1971]])
* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (written around [[1940]], published [[1976]])

==Quotation==
*&quot;The young people think the old people are fools, but the old people ''know'' the young people are fools&quot; &amp;ndash; Miss Marple's motto, in several of the books and stories.
==[[Film|Movies]]==
[[Image:Margaret_Rutherford_is_Miss_Marple.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Rutherford]] as '''Miss Marple''']]

Although popular from her first appearance in [[1930]], Jane Marple had to wait thirty-two years for her first big-screen appearance; when she made it, the results were disappointing to both Christie purists and Christie herself. ''[[Murder, She Said]]'' ([[1962]], directed by [[George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Dame [[Margaret Rutherford]], a magnificent comic actress but too boisterous and loud for the prim and birdlike character Christie created. This first film was based on the [[1957]] novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy doesn't see anything because there is no Mrs. McGillicuddy. Miss Marple herself sees apparent murder committed on a train passing hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. 

The other Rutherford films (all directed by George Pollock) were ''Murder at the Gallop'' ([[1963]]), based on the [[1953]] Hercule Poirot novel ''[[After the Funeral]]''; ''Murder Most Foul'' ([[1964]]), based on the [[1952]] Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''Murder Ahoy'' ([[1964]]), not based on any Christie work. 

In [[1980]], [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''The Mirror Crack'd'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's [[1962]] novel. However, Lansbury is only on screen for a short time, the bulk of the film being taken up with the machinations of an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork.

American stage and screen legend [[Helen Hayes]] portrayed Miss Marple in two American made-for-TV movies, both for [[CBS]]: ''A Caribbean Mystery'' ([[1983]]) and ''Murder with Mirrors'' ([[1984]]). [[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy.

==Television and Radio==
American TV was the setting for the first dramatic portrayal of Miss Marple. [[Gracie Fields]], a legendary British actress, played the geriatric sleuth in a [[1956]] episode of ''Goodyear TV Playhouse'' based on ''A Murder Is Announced'', the [[1950]] Christie novel. 

There was a long-running and popular [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] TV series in the [[1980s]] with [[Joan Hickson]], an octogenarian herself, who had appeared in a small role in the Rutherford film ''Murder, She Said''. The consensus among Christie devotees was that hers was the definitive performance. All twelve Miss Marple novels were dramatized: ''The Body in the Library''; ''The Moving Finger''; ''A Murder Is Announced''; ''A Pocket Full of Rye''; ''Murder at the Vicarage''; ''Sleeping Murder''; ''At Bertram's Hotel''; ''Nemesis''; ''4:50 from Paddington''; ''A Caribbean Mystery''; ''They Do It with Mirrors'' and ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side''. All these serializations were shown in the United States on the [[PBS]] ''[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple/index.html Mystery!]'' series. It was also televised in Germany.  The television show followed the plots of the books considerably more closely than did the Rutherford films.

[[BBC Radio 4]] also dramatised several of the books with [[June Whitfield]] as Miss Marple.  

[[Angela Lansbury]], after playing Miss Marple in ''The Mirror Crack'd'', went on to star in the TV series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' as [[Jessica Fletcher]], a novelist who solves crimes. The character was to some degree based on Miss Marple and another Christie character, [[Ariadne Oliver]].

[[Image:Geraldine McEwan.jpg|thumb|right|Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple]]
In 2004, [[Granada Television]], in collaboration with [[Agatha Christie Limited]], produced four adaptations (namely ''The Body in the Library'', ''Murder in the Vicarage'', ''4.50 from Paddington'' and ''A Murder is Announced'') starring [[Geraldine McEwan]] in the title role, and also featuring [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Ian Richardson]], [[Zoe Wanamaker]], [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Janet McTeer]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Claire Skinner]] and [[Stephen Tompkinson]] in supporting roles. In 2005 and 2006, four more mysteries are being made...but two of them aren't even Miss Marple books! They are [[Sleeping Murder]], [[The Moving Finger]], [[By the Pricking of My Thumbs (novel)]], and [[The Sittaford Mystery]].

In 2004, [[NHK]] (a Japanese TV network) produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''[[Agatha Christie's Famous Detectives Poirot and Marple]] (アガサ・クリスティーの名探偵ポワロとマープル, Agasa Kurisutii no Meitantei Powaro to Maapuru)'', as well as a manga series by the same title released starting in 2005. The series ran from [[July 4]], [[2004]] through [[May 15]], [[2005]], and is now being shown as [[rerun]]s on NHK and other networks in Japan. Poirot was voiced by [[Kōtarō Satomi]] (里見 浩太朗, Satomi Kōtarō) and Miss Marple was voiced by [[Kaoru Yachigusa]] (八千草 薫, Yachigusa Kaoru).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AprilCalendar}}
{{wiktionarypar|April}}
'''April''' is the [[fourth]] [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and one of four with the length of 30 [[day]]s.

April begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of [[Aries]] and ends in the sign of [[Taurus]]. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of [[Pisces]] and ends in the constellation of [[Aries]].

The derivation of the name ([[Latin]] ''aprillis'') is uncertain. The traditional etymology from the Latin ''aperire'', &quot;to open,&quot; in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to &quot;open,&quot; is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of &amp;alpha;&amp;#788;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;xi;&amp;iota;&amp;sigmaf; (opening) for spring. Since all the Roman months were named in honour of divinities, and as April was sacred to Venus, the ''Festum Veneris et Fortunae Virilis'' being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month Aphrilis, from her Greek name Aphrodite, or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''Apru''. Jacob Grimm suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''

The Anglo-Saxons called April ''Oster-monath'' or ''Eostur-monath'', the period sacred to ''Eostre'' or ''Ostara'', the pagan Saxon goddess of spring, from whose name is derived the modern Easter.  St George's day is the twenty-third of the month; and St Mark's Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth. In China the symbolical ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood takes place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to our April; and in Japan the feast of Dolls is celebrated in the same month.

The &quot;days of April&quot; (''journées d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a series of insurrections at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of Louis Philippe in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''procès d'avrill''. 

April was originally the second month of the [[Roman calendar]] and had 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]]'s calendar [[Julian calendar|reform]] in [[45 BCE]] resulted in April having 30 days and becoming the fourth month, as the year now began in [[January]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AugustCalendar}}

'''August''' is the [[eighth]] month of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and one of seven Gregorian months with the length of 31 [[days]].

August begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of [[Leo]] and ends in the sign of [[Virgo]]. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] and ends in the constellation of [[Leo]].

August was named in honor of [[Augustus]]. The month reputedly has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[July]]. Augustus placed the month where it is because that is when [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] died.  Before Augustus renamed August, it was called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], since it was the sixth month in the [[Roman calendar]] which started in [[March]].

In the [[neopaganism|pagan]] [[wheel of the year]] August begins at or near [[Lughnasadh]] in the [[northern hemisphere]] and [[Imbolc]] in the [[southern hemisphere]].

In [[Ireland]], (in the [[Irish language]])  August is known as '''Lúnasa''', a modern rendition of [[Lughnasadh]], named after the god [[Lugh]] and  [[August 1]], (Lá Lúnasa) in the [[Irish Calendar]] is still regarded as the first day of [[Autumn]]. The first Monday in August is one of the [[public holidays in the Republic of Ireland]].

In the [[Japanese calendar|old Japanese calendar]], the month is called ''hatsuki'' (&amp;#33865;&amp;#26376;).

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the month is called ''elokuu'', meaning &quot;month of reaping&quot;.

In the [[UK]], August is generally when all academic exam results are published, especially for [[GCSE]]s and [[A-Levels]] as well as other exams. Also, scholars and school workers such as teachers, have a holiday or non-contact time, and there are two bank holidays (UK). It is typically when people go on holiday due to the availability of time.  

During August 13 to 19, [[Philippines]] schools and theaters celebrate the National Week of the [[Tagalog|Filipino]] Language.

In [[Spain]], August is the holiday month for most workers.

In [[Brazil]], folk superstition associates bad luck to August, with the proverb ''&quot;Agosto, o mês do desgosto&quot;'' (&quot;August, the month of misfortune&quot;) being often heard. This may come from the sinister memories of the [[Bartholomew|St. Bartholomew]]'s day (August 24), which is particularly dreaded in the Northeast of the country. August 24 is also, in the tradition of [[Candomblé]], the day of [[Eshu]], one of the most malevolent deities. Coincidentally, some unfortunate polical events took place in August, like the suicide of the then President [[Getúlio Vargas]]. [http://www.tvgazeta.com.br/todoseu/assuntos_programas_notas.php?v_id_notas=55&amp;r_titulo=A]

Every last Sunday of August, the [[Philippines]] celebrates National Heroes Day in commemoration of the First Cry of the Philippine Revolution on [[August 23]], [[1896]].

August is also the name of a Japanese [[visual novel]] company.

* Women's Small Business Month

==Trivia==

*'''August''' begins on the same day of the week as '''February''' in a leap year.
*August's [[flower]] is the [[poppy]].
*August's [[birthstone]] is the [[peridot]].
*August contains no [[United States]] holiday.
*August in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is the seasonal equivalent to [[February]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and vise versa.

[[Image:GoldCalf.jpg|thumb|right|]]

'''Aaron'''
('''&amp;#1488;&amp;#1463;&amp;#1492;&amp;#1458;&amp;#1512;&amp;#1465;&amp;#1503;''', a word meaning &quot;bearer of martyrs&quot; in Hebrew (perhaps also, or instead, related to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] &quot;Aha Rw,&quot; &quot;Warrior Lion&quot;), [[Standard Hebrew]] '''Aharon''', [[Tiberian Hebrew]] '''&amp;#702;Ah&amp;#259;r&amp;#333;n'''), was one of two brothers who play a unique part in the history of the [[Hebrew people]]. He was the elder son of [[Amram]] and [[Jochebed]] of the tribe of [[Levi]]; [[Moses]], the other son, being three years younger, and [[Miriam]], their sister, several years older ([[Exodus]] 2:4; [[Exodus]] 6:16 ff.; [[Numbers]] 33:39). Aaron was the great-grandson of [[Levi]] ([[Exodus]] 6:16-20) and represented the priestly functions of his tribe. While [[Moses]] was receiving his education at the [[Egypt]]ian court and during his exile among the [[Midianites]], Aaron and his sister remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of [[Egypt]]. Here he gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech; so that when the time came for the demand upon [[Pharaoh]] to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s ''nabi '', or spokesman, to his own people ([[Exodus]] 4:16) and, after their unwillingness to hear, to [[Pharaoh]] himself ([[Exodus]] 7:9).

==His function==
Aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the court on behalf of [[Moses]], who was always the central moving figure. The part played by Aaron in the events that preceded the [[Exodus]] was, therefore, ministerial, and not directive. He, along with [[Moses]], performed “signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers ([[Exodus]] 4:15-16). At the command of [[Moses]] he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues ([[Exodus]] 7:19, 8:1, 12). In the infliction of the remaining plagues he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of [[Moses]], whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon [[Pharaoh]] and his subjects ([[Exodus]] 9:23, 10:13, 22). The potency of Aaron’s rod had already been demonstrated by its victory over the rods of the [[Egypt]]ian magicians, which it swallowed after all the rods alike had been turned into serpents ([[Exodus]] 7:9 ''et seq.''). During the journey in the wilderness Aaron is not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct.  At the battle with [[Amalek]] he is chosen with [[Hur]] to support the hand of [[Moses]] that held the “rod of [[God]]” ([[Exodus]] 17:9 ''et seq.''). When the revelation was given to [[Moses]] at [[Sinai]], he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied [[Moses]] on the way to the summit. [[Joshua]], however, was admitted with his leader to the very presence of [[the Lord]], while Aaron and [[Hur]] remained below to look after the people ([[Exodus]] 24:9-14). It was during the prolonged absence of [[Moses]] that Aaron yielded to the clamors of the people, and made a golden calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from [[Egypt]] ([[Exodus]] 32:1-6). At the intercession of [[Moses]], Aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people ([[Deuteronomy]] 9:20; [[Exodus]] 32:35), although it was to Aaron’s tribe of [[Levi]] that the work of punitive vengeance was committed ([[Exodus]] 32:26 ''et seq.'').

==Becomes priest of Israel==
At the time when the tribe of [[Levi]] was set apart for the priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in its manifold duties ([[Exodus]] 28 and 29). On the very day of his consecration his sons, [[Nadab|Nadav]] and [[Abihu|Avihu]], were consumed by fire from [[the Lord]] for having offered incense in an unlawful manner ([[Leviticus]] 10).

==Rebellion of [[Korah]]==
From the time of the sojourn at [[Sinai]], where he became the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of [[Moses]], his place being taken by [[Joshua]]. He is mentioned in association with [[Miriam]] in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of [[Moses]] as [[the Lord]]’s prophet. The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and [[Miriam]] was smitten with ''tzara'as''. Aaron entreated [[Moses]] to intercede for her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity; and [[Miriam]], after seven days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor ([[Numbers]] 12). It is noteworthy that the prophet [[Micah]] (6:4) mentions [[Moses]], Aaron, and [[Miriam]] as the leaders of Israel after the [[Exodus]] (a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives). In the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle ([[Numbers]] 12:6-8) that [[Moses]] was unique among men as the one with whom [[the Lord]] spoke face to face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of [[Miriam]] and Aaron. The validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was attested after the ill-fated rebellion of [[Korah]], who was a first cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents ([[Numbers]] 16:25-35), [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of [[Moses]], took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed ([[Numbers]] 17:1-15, 16:36-50, Authorized Version). Another memorable transaction followed. Each of the tribal princes of Israel took a rod and wrote his name upon it, and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting. On the morrow Aaron’s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and borne ripe almonds ([[Numbers]] 17:8; see [[Aaron’s Rod]]). The miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of [[Levi]]; but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of Aaron and the other [[Levites]]. While all the [[Levites]] (and only [[Levites]]) were to be devoted to sacred services, the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone ([[Numbers]] 18:1-7). The scene of this enactment is unknown, nor is the time mentioned.

==Death==
Aaron, like [[Moses]], was not permitted to enter [[Canaan]] with the successful invaders. The reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage ([[Numbers]] 20:12, 13), when they, or rather [[Moses]], brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people. The action was construed as displaying a want of deference to [[the Lord]], since they had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas [[Moses]] struck it with the wonder-working rod ([[Numbers]] 20:7-11). Of the death of Aaron we have two accounts. The principal one gives a detailed statement to the effect that, soon after the above incident, Aaron, with his son [[Eleazar]] and [[Moses]], ascended [[Mount Hor]]. There [[Moses]] stripped him (Aaron) of his priestly garments, and transferred them to [[Eleazar]]. Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days ([[Numbers]] 20:22-29; compare 33:38, 39). The other account is found in [[Deuteronomy]] 10:6, where [[Moses]] is reported as saying that Aaron died at [[Mosera]] and was buried there. Some scholars think that [[Mosera]] is not on [[Mount Hor]], since the itinerary in [[Numbers]] 33:31-37 records seven stages between [[Moseroth]] ([[Mosera]]) and [[Mount Hor]].

==Typical signification in apocryphal and rabbinical literature==
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of [[God]] and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities. Thus Aaron, the typical priest, ranks far below [[Moses]]: he is but his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of [[God]] revealed through [[Moses]], although it is pointed out (Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1) that it is said fifteen times in the Pentateuch that “[[the Lord]] spoke to [[Moses]] ''and'' Aaron.” Under the influence of the priesthood which shaped the destinies of the nation under [[Persians|Persian]] rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, as is learned from [[Malachi]] 2:4-7; and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with [[Moses]]. “At times Aaron, and at other times [[Moses]], is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank,” says Mekilta בא, 1; and [[Ecclesiasticus]] ([[Sirach]]), 44:6-24, expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration.

==[[Moses]] and Aaron compared==
According to Tanḥuma (ed. Buber, 2:12), Aaron’s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of [[Moses]]. The writer of the Testaments of the Patriarchs, however, hesitates to rank [[Moses]] the faithful, “him that speaks with [[God]] as with a father,” as equal with Aaron (Testament of [[Levi]], 8:17). The rabbis are still more emphatic in their praise of Aaron’s virtues. Thus Hillel, who in Herod’s time saw before him mainly a degenerate class of priests, selfish and quarrelsome, held Aaron of old up as a mirror, saying: “Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!” (Abot, 1:12). This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and elsewhere, according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was [[Moses]]. While [[Moses]] was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse. The mourning of the people at Aaron’s death was greater, therefore, than at that of [[Moses]]; for whereas, when Aaron died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women ([[Numbers]] 20:29), [[Moses]] was bewailed by “the sons of Israel” only ([[Deuteronomy]] 34:8). Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron (Sanhedrin 7a). His fortitude and silent submission to the will of [[God]] on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify [[God]] in the midst of great affliction (Zebaḥim 115b; [[Josephus]], “[[Antiquities of the Jews]]” 3:8, § 7). Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by [[God]] after the princes of the [[Twelve Tribes]] had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: “Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light of the Law shall last forever” (Tanḥuma, ed. Buber, בהעלותך, 6).

==Death of Aaron==
In fulfillment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ([[Leviticus]] Rabbah 10, Midrash Tehilim 133:1), Aaron’s death, as described in the Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquillity. Accompanied by [[Moses]], his brother, and by [[Eleazar]], his son, Aaron went to the summit of [[Mount Hor]], where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. “Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son [[Eleazar]]!” said [[Moses]]; “and then follow me.” Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. “Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,” [[Moses]] continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from [[God]]. The cave closed behind [[Moses]] as he left; and he went down the hill with [[Eleazar]], with garments rent, and crying: “Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!” When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, “Where is Aaron?” angels were seen carrying Aaron’s bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: “The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin” ([[Malachi]] 2:6, 7). He died, according to Seder ‘Olam R. 9, Rosh ha-Shanah 2, 3a, and [[Josephus]], “[[Antiquities of the Jews]]” 4:4, § 7, on the first of Ab. [[Josephus]] says also that “he died while the multitude looked upon him.” The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel’s camp disappeared at Aaron’s death (see Seder ‘Olam, 9 and Rosh ha-Shanah 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between [[Numbers]] 20:22 ''et seq.'' and [[Deuteronomy]] 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron’s death on [[Mount Hor]] was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to [[Moseroth|Mosera]], where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: “There [at [[Moseroth|Mosera]]] died Aaron.” See Mekilta, Beshallaḥ, Wayassa’, 1; Tanḥuma, Huḳḳat, 18; Yerushalmi Soṭah, 1:17c, and Targum Yerushalmi [[Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]] on the above-mentioned passages.
The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and [[Moses]]. When the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another’s greatness. When [[Moses]] at first declined to go to [[Pharaoh]], saying: “O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send” ([[Exodus]] 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but [[the Lord]] reassured him, saying: “Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart” ([[Exodus]] 4:14). Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says Simon ben Yoḥai; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother’s rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which were to “be upon Aaron’s heart when he goeth in before [[the Lord]]” (Canticles Rabbah 1:10). [[Moses]] and Aaron met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers ([[Exodus]] 4:27; compare [[Song of Songs]], 8:1), and of them it is written: “Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!” ([[Psalms]] 133:1). Of them it is said ([[Psalms]] 85:10): “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]”; for [[Moses]] stood for righteousness, according to [[Deuteronomy]] 33:21, and Aaron for peace, according to [[Malachi]] 2:6. Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to [[Deuteronomy]] 33:8, and truth in [[Moses]], according to [[Numbers]] 12:7 (Tanḥuma, Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26).
When [[Moses]] poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: “Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office.” Then the Holy Spirit spake the words: “Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of [[Hermon]]” ([[Psalms]] 133:2, 3, ''Heb''.; Sifra, Shemini, Milluim; Tanḥuma, [[Korah]], ed. Buber, 14). 

==Genetics==
Recently, the tradition that [[Kohanim]] are actually descended from Aaron was supported by [[genetic testing]] (Skorecki et al., 1997). Since all direct male lineage shares a common [[Y chromosome]], testing was done across sectors of the Jewish population to see if there was any commonality between their Y chromosomes. There was proven to be certain distinctions among the [[Cohen modal haplotype]], implying that the Kohanim do share some common ancestry. This information was used to support the claim of the [[Lemba]] (a [[sub-Saharan]] tribe) that they were in fact, a tribe of Jews.

==According to the documentary hypothesis==
The Biblical representation of his character, negative and shadowy compared with Moses's, may be viewed in several ways. A clue to the seemingly contradictory delineations of Aaron (other than the obvious explanation that he is a complex character) is found in the framework of documentary analysis (see also ''[[Hexateuch]]''), which is accepted by some but not all scholars. According to those who accept the [[documentary hypothesis]], the following portions of text belong to (1) [[Elohist|E]], (2) [[Jahwist|J]], (3) [[Deuteronomist|D]], and (4) [[Priestly source|P]] sources, respectively, with the fifth item being from ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]''.

#'''Aaron as fallible'''. These passages do not represent Aaron as a sacrosanct [[priest]]. He comes to meet Moses (''Exodus'' 4:14), supports him in war (Exodus 17:12) and jurisprudence (Exodus 24:14). He yields to the people and makes the [[Golden Calf|calf]] (Exodus 32), and, with [[Miriam]], [[Snow-white Miriam|criticises Moses]] for marrying a [[Cush]]ite woman. Miriam is subsequently punished (''Numbers'' 12). He is present at the sacrificial covenant meal between [[Israel]] and the [[Kenite]]s (Exodus 18:12). In this aspect, [[Joshua]], instead of Aaron, serves in the Tent (Exodus 33:11).
#'''Aaron as Moses's prophet'''. This representation concerns the covenant meal on [[Sinai]] (Exodus 24:1, 2, 9-11) and the vague charge that Aaron &quot;let the people loose&quot; (Exodus 32:25). Aaron seems to be an afterthought in the plague narrative (Exodus 8:25). In both this and the last view, Moses is the viceregent of God and Aaron is Moses' prophet (Exodus 4:16, 7:1).
#'''Aaron as idolatrous'''. In ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 9, Aaron is partly responsible for the building of the [[Golden Calf]]. The story says that [[Yahweh]] is so angry toward Aaron that he was about to destroy him. It appears that it is only Moses's intercessory prayer and his destruction of the Golden Calf which saves Aaron. The account of his death in Deuteromy 10:6 is different from that in Numbers 20:22. According to Deuteronomy it occurred at [[Moseroth|Moserah]], seven stations from [[Mount Hor]] (Numbers 33:30), in the early months of the wandering because of the sign of the Golden Calf. The only other passage in reference to Aaron in Deuteronomy merely states that he is the brother of Moses (Deuteronomy 32:50).
#'''Aaron as subordinate'''. The first three, simpler, plagues Aaron brings on at Moses' command; thereafter Moses himself is the actor. In the narratives (Numbers 16, 17) it is Moses in each case who vindicates him. Aaron dies at Mount Hor in the fortieth year of the Exodus (Numbers 20:22, 33:38), because of rebellion at [[Meribah]] (cf. Deuteronomy as above).
#'''Aaron as non-priestly'''. In ''[[Leviticus]]'' 17-26, Aaron appears only in redactional passages connecting the [[Law of Holiness]] with its present context. In ''Ezekiel'' 40-48 Zadok, not Aaron, is the eponym of the priestly line (44:15, etc.).

==In the Qur’an==
In the [[Qur'an]] he is known as [[Harun]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about organic compounds containing -OH groups. For other uses, see [[Alcohol (disambiguation)]].''

In [[chemistry]], '''alcohol''' is any [[organic compound]] in which a [[hydroxyl]] [[Functional group|group]] (''-[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]'') is bound to a [[carbon]] atom, which in turn is bound to other [[hydrogen]] and/or [[carbon]] atoms.  The general formula for a simple [[acyclic]] alcohol is '''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;OH'''.

In general usage, '''alcohol''' refers almost always to [[ethanol]], also known as '''grain alcohol''', and often to any beverage that contains ethanol (see ''[[alcoholic beverage]]''). This sense underlies the term [[alcoholism]] ([[addiction]] to alcohol). As a [[Medication|drug]], ethanol is known to have a [[depressant|depressing effect]] that decreases the responses of the [[central nervous system]] (see [[effects of alcohol on the body]]).  Other forms of alcohol are usually described with a clarifying adjective, as in ''[[isopropyl alcohol]]'' or by the suffix ''-ol'', as in ''isopropanol''.

The word dates to the 16th century when it was used to refer to any chemical substance arrived at by sublimation.  This derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''alcohol'' (&quot;powdered ore of [[antimony]]&quot;), originating from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{ArabDIN|al-kuḥūl}}'' ({{ar|&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604;}}), which is also the source of ''[[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]'' and related to the root ''k-ḥ-l'', attested in the [[Arabic]] word for eye makeup.

== Structure ==
[[Image:alcohol_general.jpg|150px|right|An alcohol]]

The [[functional group]] of an alcohol is a [[hydroxyl group]] bonded to an sp³ hybridized carbon. It can therefore be regarded as a derivative of [[water_(molecule)|water]], with an [[alkyl]] group replacing one of the hydrogens. If an [[aryl]] group is present rather than an alkyl, the compound is generally called a [[phenol]] rather than an alcohol.  Also, if the [[hydroxyl group]] is bonded to one of the sp² hybridized carbons of an alkenyl group, the compound is referred to as an [[enol]].  The oxygen in an alcohol has a bond angle of around 109&amp;deg; (c.f. 104.5&amp;deg; in water), and two nonbonded electron pairs. The O-H bond in methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) is around 96 pico[[metre]]s long.

=== Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols ===
There are three major subsets of alcohols- 'primary' (1°), 'secondary' (2°) and 'tertiary' (3°), based upon the number of carbons the C-OH carbon (shown in red) is bonded to. [[Methanol]] is the simplest 'primary' alcohol.  The simplest secondary alcohol is [[isopropanol]] (propan-2-ol), and a simple tertiary alcohol is ''tert''-[[butanol]] (2-methylpropan-2-ol).

[[Image:alcohol_common.jpg|450px|Some common alcohols]]

=== Methanol &amp; ethanol ===
The simplest and most commonly used alcohols are [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]] (common names [[methyl]] alcohol and [[ethyl]] alcohol, respectively), which have the structures shown above.

Methanol was formerly obtained by the distillation of wood, and was called &quot;wood alcohol&quot;.  It is now a cheap commodity chemical produced by the high pressure reaction of [[carbon monoxide]] with [[hydrogen]]. In common usage, &quot;alcohol&quot; often refers simply to ethanol or &quot;grain alcohol&quot;. [[Methylated spirits]] (&quot;Meths&quot;), also called &quot;surgical spirits&quot;, is a form of ethanol rendered undrinkable by the addition of methanol. Aside from its major use in alcoholic beverages, ethanol is also used (though highly controlled) as an industrial solvent and raw material.

== Uses ==
Alcohols are in wide use in industry and science as reagents, [[solvent]]s, and [[alcohol as a fuel|fuel]]s. Ethanol and methanol can be made to burn more cleanly than [[gasoline]] or [[diesel]]. Because of its low toxicity and ability to dissolve non-polar substances, ethanol is often used as a solvent in medical drugs, [[perfume]]s, and vegetable essences such as [[vanilla]]. In [[organic synthesis]], alcohols frequently serve as versatile intermediates.

Ethanol is also commonly used in beverages after fermentation to promote flavor or induce a euphoric intoxication commonly known as &quot;drunkenness&quot; or &quot;being drunk&quot;. The use of ethanol for this purpose is illegal in some jurisdictions. In such instances of consumption, alcohol is a [[Psychoactive drug|drug]], with immediate potential for overdose, toxic poisoning, and physiological dependency (known as [[alcoholism]]). Alcoholism has become one of the most common drug addictions (if not second to caffeine) in the world. The physiological dependency caused by alcoholism means that the user experiences physical withdrawal (in the form of a headache known as a &quot;[[hangover]],&quot; extremely high anxiety known as &quot;the shakes,&quot; and restlessness or trouble sleeping) upon cessation or decrease of use. For the full article on this topic see [[effects of alcohol on the body]].

Because of such particular uses, historically, ethanol has been regulated by taxation. Those who manufacture it for other purposes often avoid this expense by &quot;denaturing&quot; it in a manner that renders it unfit for drinking.  A common way to do this is by the addition of [[denatonium benzoate]]. &quot;SD-40&quot; and &quot;SD Alcohol&quot; sometimes followed by &quot;40-B&quot; are designations that were established by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] for this formulation.

== Sources ==
Many alcohols can be created by [[fermentation]] of [[fruit]]s or [[cereal|grain]]s with [[yeast]], but only ethanol is commercially produced this way, chiefly for [[alcohol as a fuel|fuel]] and [[alcoholic beverage|drink]]. Other alcohols are generally produced by synthetic routes from [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]], or [[coal]] feed stocks, for example via acid catalyzed [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of [[alkene]]s.  For more details see [[#Chemistry of alcohols|Chemistry of alcohols]]

== Nomenclature ==
=== Systematic names ===
In the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] system, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal &quot;e&quot; and adds &quot;ol&quot;, e.g. &quot;methanol&quot; and &quot;ethanol&quot;. When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the &quot;ol&quot;: [[propan-1-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(OH)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Sometimes, the position number is written before the IUPAC name: 1-propanol and 2-propanol. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]] or [[carboxylic acid]]), then it is necessary to use the prefix &quot;hydroxy&quot;, for example: 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH).

Some examples of simple alcohols and how to name them:

[[Image:Alcohol_examples.gif|550px|Examples of alcohols &amp; their names]]

Common names for alcohols usually take the name of the corresponding [[alkyl]] group and add the word &quot;alcohol&quot;, e.g. [[methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl]] alcohol or [[Butyl|''tert''-butyl]] alcohol.  [[Propyl]] alcohol may be ''n''-propyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the 1st or 2nd carbon on the propane chain. Isopropyl alcohol is also occasionally called ''sec''-propyl alcohol.

As mentioned above alcohols are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) or tertiary (3°), and common names often indicate this in the alkyl group prefix. For example (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH is a tertiary alcohol is commonly known as ''tert''-butyl alcohol. This would be named 2-methylpropan-2-ol under IUPAC rules, indicating a propane chain with methyl and hydroxyl groups both attached to the middle (#2) carbon.

An alcohol with two hydroxyl groups is commonly called a &quot;glycol&quot;, e.g. HO-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH is [[ethylene glycol]]. The IUPAC name is ethane-1,2-diol, &quot;diol&quot; indicating two hydroxyl groups, and 1,2 indicating their bonding positions. Geminal glycols (with the two hydroxyls on the same carbon atom), such as ethane-1,1-diol, are generally unstable.  For three or four groups, &quot;triol&quot; and &quot;tetraol&quot; are used.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;alcohol&quot; almost certainly comes from the [[Arabic language]] (the &quot;al-&quot; prefix being the Arabic definite article); however, the precise origin is unclear. It was introduced into [[Europe]], together with the art of [[distillation]] and the substance itself, around the [[12th century]] by various European authors who translated and popularized the discoveries of [[Islamic]] [[alchemy|alchemists]].

A popular theory, found in many dictionaries, is that it comes from &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1604; = ''ALKHL'' = ''al-kuhul'', originally the name of very finely powdered [[antimony]] [[sulfide]] [[antimony|Sb]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; used as an [[antiseptic]] and [[eyeliner]]. The powder is prepared by [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] in a closed vessel.  According to this theory, the meaning of ''alkuhul'' would have been first extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol. This conjectured etymology has been circulating in England since [[1672]] at least ([[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]).

However, this derivation is suspicious since the current Arabic name for alcohol,  &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1603;&amp;#1581;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604; = ''ALKHWL'' = ''al???'', does not derive from ''al-kuhul''. The [[Qur'an]] in verse 37:47 uses the word &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1594;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1604; = ''ALGhWL'' = ''al-ghawl'' &amp;mdash; properly meaning &quot;spirit&quot; (&quot;[[spiritual being]]&quot;) or &quot;[[demon]]&quot; &amp;mdash; with the sense &quot;the thing that gives the wine its headiness&quot;. The word ''al-ghawl'' also originated the [[English language|English]] word &quot;ghoul&quot;, and the name of the star [[Algol]]. This derivation would, of course, be consistent with the use of &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;spirit of wine&quot; as synonymous of &quot;alcohol&quot; in most Western languages.  (Incidentally, the etymology &quot;alcohol&quot; = &quot;the devil&quot; was used in the [[1930s]] by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Temperance movement|Temperance Movement]] for propaganda purposes.)

According to the second theory, the popular etymology and the spelling &quot;alcohol&quot; would not be due to generalization of the meaning of ''ALKHL'', but rather to Western alchemists and authors confusing the two words ''ALKHL'' and ''ALGhWL'', which have indeed been transliterated in many different and overlapping ways.

== Physical and chemical properties ==
The [[hydroxyl group]] generally makes the alcohol molecule [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to other compounds. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. [[Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends.  Alcohols of five or more carbons ([[amyl alcohol|Pentanol]] and higher) are effectively insoluble because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance.

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents. This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as [[protic solvent]]s.

The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles.

Alcohols, like water, can show either acidic or basic properties at the O-H group.  With a [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of around 16-19 they are generally slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]], but they are still able to react with strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or reactive metals such as [[sodium]].  The salts that result are called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metal|M]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Alcohols conjugated to aromatic rings have a lower pKa (around 10). Electron-withdrawing groups also work to make alcohols more acidic. For example, Para-nitro phenol has a pKa of 7.15.

Meanwhile the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base_(chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]].  For example, with methanol:

[[Image:methanol_acid_base.gif|500px|Acidity &amp; basicity of methanol]]

Alcohols can also undergo [[oxidation]] to give [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s, or they can be dehydrated to [[alkene]]s.  They can react to form [[ester compound]]s, and they can (if activated first) undergo [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions. For more details see the [[#Chemistry of alcohols]] section below.

== Toxicity ==
Alcohols often have an odor described as 'biting' that 'hangs' in the nasal passages. [[Ethanol]] in the form of [[alcoholic beverage]]s has been consumed by humans since pre-historic times, for a variety of hygienic, dietary, medicinal, religious, and recreational reasons. While infrequent consumption of ethanol in small quantities may be harmless or even beneficial, larger doses result in a state known as [[drunkenness]] or intoxication and, depending on the dose and regularity of use, can cause acute respiratory failure or death and with chronic use has medical repercussions.

Other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol, partly because they take much longer to be metabolized, and often their metabolism produces even more toxic substances. Methanol, or ''wood alcohol'', for instance, is oxidized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s in the liver to the poisonous [[formaldehyde]], which can cause blindness or death. 

An effective treatment to prevent formaldehyde toxicity after methanol ingestion is to administer ethanol. This will bind to alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing methanol from binding and thus acting as a [[substrate]]. Any formaldehyde will be converted to [[formic acid]] and excreted before it causes damage.

==  Preparation of alcohols ==
=== Laboratory ===
Several methods exist for the preparation of alcohols in the laboratory.
* Primary [[Alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead).
* [[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[reduction|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]]. (after an acidic workup)
* [[Alkenes]] engage in a [[acid]] catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] as a catalyst which gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols.
* The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis.
* [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydratation is shown:

[[Image:alcohol_prep.gif|center|350px|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]]

=== Industrial ===
Industrially alcohols are produced in several ways.
* by [[fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37°C to produce ethanol. For instance the conversion of [[invertase]] to [[glucose]] and [[fructose]] or the conversion of [[glucose]] to [[zymase]] and [[ethanol]].
* By direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]]: using [[ethene]] or other alkenes from [[cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]]. Uses a catalyst of [[phosphoric acid]] under high temperature and pressure.
* [[Methanol]] is producted from water gas: It is manufactured from [[Syngas|synthesis gas]], where [[carbon monoxide]] and 2 equivalents of hydrogen gas are combined to produce [[methanol]] using a [[copper]], [[zinc oxide]] and [[aluminium oxide]] catalyst at 250°C and a pressure of 50-100 atm.

== Reactions of alcohols ==
=== Deprotonation ===
Alcohols can behave as weak acids, undergoing deprotonation. The deprotonation reaction to produce an [[alkoxide]] salt is either performed with a strong base such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]], or with sodium or potassium metal.

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium hydride|NaH]]  &amp;rarr;  2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;uarr;

: 2 R-OH + 2[[Sodium|Na]] &amp;rarr; 2R-O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

: e.g. 2 [[Ethanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH]] + 2 Na  &amp;rarr;  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Water is similar in [[pKa|pK&lt;Sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] to many alcohols, so with [[sodium hydroxide]] there is an equilibrium set up which usually lies to the left:

: R-OH + [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]  &lt;=&gt;  R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (equilibrium to the left)

It should be noted, though, that the bases used to deprotonate alcohols are strong themselves. The bases used and the alkoxides created are both highly moisture sensitive chemical reagents.

=== Nucleophilic substitution ===
The [[hydroxyl|OH]] group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions.  However if the oxygen is first protonated to give R&amp;minus;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the leaving group ([[water_(molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and nucleophilic substitution can take place.  For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom.  If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed.  Alternatively  the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Alcohol_reaction_examples.gif|550px|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may likewise be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH  +  PBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  3 RBr  +  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

=== Dehydration ===
Alcohols are themselves nucleophilic, so R&amp;minus;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can react with ROH to produce [[ether]]s and water in a [[dehydration reaction]], although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of [[diethyl ether]].

More useful is the E1 [[elimination reaction]] of alcohols to produce [[alkene]]s.  The reaction generally obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed.  Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols requre a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethene]]:

[[image:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|550px]]

=== Esterification ===
To form an [[ester]] from an [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] the reaction, known as [[Fischer esterification]], is usually performed at [[reflux]] with a [[catalyst]] of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]:

: R-OH  +  R'-COOH  &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  R'-COOR  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In order to drive the equilibrium to the right and produce a good [[yield_(chemistry)|yield]] of ester, water is usually removed, either by an excess of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or by using a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].  Esters may also be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with an [[acid chloride]] in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]].

Other types of ester are prepared similarly- for example [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

=== Oxidation===
Primary alcohols generally give [[aldehyde]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s upon [[organic oxidation|oxidation]], while secondary alcohols give [[ketone]]s. Traditionally strong [[Redox|oxidants]] such as the [[dichromate]] ion or [[potassium permanganate]] are used, under acidic conditions, for example:

:3 [[Isopropanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH(-OH)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  [[Potassium dichromate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  4 [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  &amp;rarr;  3 [[Acetone|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C(=O)-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  7 [[Water_(molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]

Frequently in [[aldehyde]] preparations these reagents cause a problem of over-oxidation to the [[carboxylic acid]]. To avoid this, other reagents such as [[Pyridinium chlorochromate|PCC]], [[Dess-Martin periodinane]], [[2-Iodoxybenzoic acid]], [[TPAP]] or methods such as [[Swern oxidation]] are now preferred.

Alcohols with a [[methyl]] group attached to the alcohol carbon can also undergo a [[haloform reaction]] (such as the [[iodoform reaction]]) in the presence of the [[halogen]] and a base such as sodium hydroxide.

Tertiary alcohols resist oxidation, but can be oxidised by reagents such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone.

[[Image:Achill_Ireland_Keem_bay.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Keem bay on Achill island is said to be one of the most beautiful beaches in Ireland.]]

'''Achill Island''' ''([[Irish language|Irish]]; Acaill, Oileán Acla)'' in [[County Mayo]] is the largest island off [[Ireland]], and is situated off the west coast. It has a population of 2700. Its area is 57 [[square miles]] (146 [[square kilometres]]). Achill is attached to the mainland by [[Michael Davitt Bridge]], between the villages of [[Achill Sound]] and Polranny, so it is possible to drive onto the island. This is a [[swing bridge]] which allows the passage of small boats. A bridge was first completed here in 1886, and replaced by the current structure after [[World War II]]. Other centres of population include the villages of Keel, Dooagh, Dooega and Dugort. The island's [[Gaelic football|football]] pitch and two secondary schools are on the mainland at Polranny. Early settlements are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BCE. A paddle dating from this period was found at the [[crannog]] near Dookinella.

The island is 87 per cent [[peat bog]]. The parish of Achill also includes the Corraun peninsula. The people of Corraun consider themselves Achill people, and most natives of Achill refer to this area as being &quot;in Achill&quot;. In the summer of 1996, the [[RNLI]] decided to station a [[lifeboat]] at Kildownet.

==History==
It is believed that at the end of the [[Neolithic Period]] (around 4000 BCE), Achill had a population of 500-1000 people. The island would have been mostly forest until the Neolithic people began crop cultivation. Settlememt increased during the [[Iron Age]], and the dispersal of small forts around the coast indicate the warlike nature of the times. [[Grace O'Malley|Granuaile]] maintained a castle at Kildownet in the [[sixteenth century]].

In the [[seventeenth century|seventeenth]] and [[eighteenth century|eighteenth]] centuries, there was much migration to Achill from other parts of Ireland, particularly [[Ulster]], due to the political and religious turmoil of the time. For a while there were two different [[dialect]]s of [[Irish language|Irish]] being spoken on Achill. This led to many townlands being recorded as having two names during the 1824 Ordnace Survey, and some maps today give different names for the same place. Achill Irish still has many traces of [[Ulster Irish]].

Despite some unsympathetic development, the island retains some striking natural beauty.  The cliffs of Croaghaun on the northern coast of the island are the highest sea cliffs in [[Europe]] but are inaccessible by road.  On the western tip near Achill Head, Keem bay is arguably one of the most beautiful beaches on the Irish west coast. [[Image:Achill_Ireland_Keel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Keel Strand.]]Keel beach is quite popular with tourists and some locals as a [[surfing]] location. Another extreme point of the island is Moytoge Head, which with its rounded appearance drops dramatically down to the ocean. An old [[United_Kingdom|British]] observation post, built during [[World War I]] to prevent the [[Germany|Germans]] landing arms for the [[Irish Republican Army]] separatist movement, is still standing on Moytoge. The mountain Slievemore (671 metres) rises dramatically in the centre of the island and the Atlantic drive (along the south/west of the island) has some dramatically beautiful views. On the slopes of Slievemore, there is an abandoned village (&quot;The Deserted Village&quot;) The Deserted Village at Slievemore was once thought to be a remnant village from An Gorta Mór (The Great Hunger, see [[Great Famine]]).  However, recent developments suggest that it is a Booley.  Specifically, the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore ([[Transhumance]]), and then go back to Dooagh in the fall. Just west of the deserted village is an old [[Martello tower]], again built by the British to warn of any possible [[France|French]] invasion. The area also boasts an approximately 5000-year old [[Neolithic tomb]]. Achillbeg (''Acaill Beag'', Little Achill) is a small island just off Achill's southern tip. Its inhabitants were resettled on Achill in the 1960's. There is a mural of a surfer on the gable of a pub in [[Cashel (Achill)|Cashel]].

==Economy==
While a number of attempts at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, the economy of the island is largely dependent on [[tourism]]. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and the [[United States]] allowed many families to remain living in Achill throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the advent of [[Ireland]]'s &quot;[[Celtic Tiger]]&quot; [[Economy of Ireland|economy]] fewer Achill people are forced to look for work abroad. [[Agriculture]] plays a small role and is only profitable because of European subsidies. The fact that the island is mostly bog means that it is limited - largely to [[sheep farming]]. In the past, [[fishing]] was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its shark fishing, [[basking shark]] in particular was fished for its valuable liver oil. There was a big spurt of growth in tourism in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]] before which life was tough and difficult on the island.  Since that heyday, the common perception is that tourism has been slowly declining.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Achill_Slievemore_Deserted_Village.jpg|250px|thumb|The &quot;Deserted Village&quot; at the foot of Slievemore was a Booley village, see [[Transhumance]]]]

Some of the recent building development on the island (over the last 40 years or so) has been contentious and in many cases is not as sympathetic to the landscape as the earlier style of [[whitewash|whitewashed]] [[barged roof]]ed [[cottage]]s.  Because of the inhospitable climate, very few houses date from before the [[20th century|twentieth century]].  An example of the style of earlier housing can be seen in the &quot;Deserted Village&quot; ruins near the graveyard at the foot of Slievemore.  Even the houses in this village represent a relatively comfortable class of dwelling as, even as recently as a hundred years ago, some people still used &quot;Beehive&quot; style houses (small circular single roomed dwellings with a hole in ceiling to let out smoke).  Many of the oldest and most picturesque inhabitated cottages date from the activities of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]] - a body set up around the turn of the twentieth century in Ireland to improve the welfare for inhabitants of small villages and towns.  Most of the homes in Achill at the time were very small and tightly packed together in villages.  The CDB subsidised the building of new, more spacious (though still small by modern standards) homes outside of the traditional villages.

==Famous people==
The artist [[Paul Henry (painter)|Paul Henry]] stayed on the island for a number of years in the early 1900s and some of his most famous paintings are of the dramatic landscape of the island. The [[Nobel Prize]] winning author, [[Heinrich Böll]], visited the island and wrote of his experience in his &quot;Irish Journal&quot; (''Irisches Tagebuch''). The Bölls later bought a cottage near Dugort and lived in it periodically until 2001 when they donated it to be used as an artists' residence. [[Graham Greene]] also spent time on Achill Island.

'''Irwin Allen Ginsberg''' ({{IPA2|ˈgɪnzˌbɝg}}) ([[June 3]], [[1926]] &amp;ndash; [[April 5]] [[1997]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Beat poet]] born in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Ginsberg is best known for [[Howl]] ([[1956]]), a long poem about [[consumer]] [[society]]'s negative [[Values#Personal and cultural values|human values]].

==Life==

Ginsberg was born on [[June 3]], [[1926]] into a Jewish family in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. His father [[Louis Ginsberg]] was a poet and his mother was a high school teacher. Ginsberg's mother, Naomi Levy Ginsberg (who was affected by [[epileptic seizures]] and [[mental illness]]es such as [[paranoia]] {{ref|Modern}}) was also an active member of the [[Communist Party USA]] and often took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings. Ginsberg later said that his mother &quot;Made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.'&quot;{{ref|BioProject}}

As a teenager, Ginsberg began to write letters to ''The [[New York Times]]'' about political issues such as [[World War II]] and workers' rights.{{ref|BioProject2}} When he was a junior in high school, he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist. The trip disturbed Ginsberg and he later described it, along with his relationship with his mother, in his long autobiographical poem ''[[Kaddish (poem)|''Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894-1956)]].''{{ref|Modern2}} 

In 1943 Ginsberg graduated from high school and briefly attended [[Montclair State University]] before entering [[Columbia University]] on a scholarship from the [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]] of Paterson. ([[1949]])[http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/08/specials/ginsberg-obit.html]. In his freshman year he met fellow undergraduate [[Lucien Carr]], who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers including [[Jack Kerouac]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[John Clellon Holmes]]. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to [[Neal Cassady]], one of the many that Ginsberg loved. Kerouac later described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady in the first chapter of his 1957 novel ''[[On the Road]].''{{ref|Modern3}}

In [[1954]] Ginsberg met [[Peter Orlovsky]], a young man of 21 with whom he fell in love and who remained his life-long lover, and with whom he eventually shared his interest in Tibetan Buddhism. Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the [[Beat_generation|Beat]] movement of the [[1950s]] and the [[hippies]] of the [[1960s]], befriending, among others, [[Timothy Leary]], [[Gregory Corso]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Bob Dylan]]. 

In 1965 Ginsberg was deported from Cuba for for publicaly protesting against Cuba's anti-marijuana stance and its penchant for throwing homosexuals in jail.

The Cubans sent him to Czechoslovakia, Where one week after being named the King of a May Day parade, Ginsberg was labeled an &quot;immoral menace&quot; by the Czech government and deported.

In 1982, he was featured on &quot;Ghetto Defendant&quot;, a song by [[The Clash]], on their album &quot;[[Combat Rock]]&quot;. Ginsberg died of cancer on [[April 5]], [[1997]].

==Career==

Ginsberg's [[poetry]] was strongly influenced by [[modernism]], [[romanticism]], the beat and cadence of [[jazz]], and his [[Kagyu]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice and [[Jew]]ish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary and [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] poetic mantle handed from the English poet and artist [[William Blake]] on to [[Walt Whitman]]. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration which he claimed. Other influences included the American poet [[William Carlos Williams]]. 

Ginsberg's principal work, &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;, is well-known to many for its opening line: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness&quot;.  It was considered scandalous at the time of publication due to the rawness of the language, which is frequently explicit.  Shortly after its [[1956]] publication by [[San Francisco]]'s [[City Lights Bookstore]], it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a [[cause célèbre]] among defenders of the [[First Amendment]], and was later lifted after judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming social importance. Ginsberg's [[leftist]] and generally anti-establishment politics attracted the attention of the [[FBI]], who regarded Ginsberg as a major security threat. [[Image:Ginsberg.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Allen Ginsberg]]

Ginsberg's spiritual journey began early on with his reported spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to [[India]] and a chance encounter on a New York City street (they both tried to catch the same cab) with [[Chögyam Trungpa]], Rinpoche, a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation master of the [[Vajrayana]] school, who became his friend and life-long teacher. Ginsberg helped found the [[Jack Kerouac]] School of Disembodied Poetics at [[Naropa University]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], a school founded by Chögyam Trungpa, Rinpoche. Music and chanting were both important parts of his live delivery during poetry readings. He often accompanied himself on a handheld organ called a harmonium, and was often accompanied by a guitarist. Attendance to his poetry readings was generally standing room only for most of his career, no matter where in the world he appeared. 

Ginsberg won the National Book Award for his book &quot;The Fall of America.&quot; In 1993, the French Minister of Culture awarded him with the medal of [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] (the Order of Arts and Letters).

In [[1994]], when the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] successfully banished all connections to the [[North American Man-Boy Love Association]] in order to gain consultative status in the United Nations, Ginsberg opposed (together with modern gay rights founder [[Harry Hay]]). He said that he supported NAMBLA's right to [[free speech]] because the hysteria over [[pederasty]] reminded him of the hysteria over homosexuality itself while he was growing up. While his poetry praised the love of youths, his interests lay mostly in young men above the age of consent.

==Quotations==

* &quot;Our goal was to save the planet and alter human consciousness.  That will take a long time, if it happens at all.&quot;
* &quot;Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does.&quot;
* &quot;Pot is fun.&quot;
* &quot;The only thing that can save the world is the reclaiming of the awareness of the world. That's what poetry does.&quot;
* &quot;Master thyself and others will follow.&quot;
* &quot;First thought, best thought.&quot; (referring to his, and other Beat writers' unique style of writing poetry)
* &quot;The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''algebraically closed''' if every [[polynomial]] in one variable of degree at least &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, with [[coefficient]]s in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, has a [[root (mathematics)|zero]] ([[root (mathematics)|root]]) in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, the field of [[real number]]s is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation

:&lt;math&gt;3x^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

has no solution in real numbers, even though both of its coefficients (&lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) are real. The same argument proves that the field of [[rational number]]s is not algebraically closed. Also, no [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed, because if &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;hellip;, &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are the elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then the polynomial 

:&lt;math&gt;(x-a_1)(x-a_2)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x-a_n)+1&lt;/math&gt;

has no zero in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the field of [[complex number]]s is algebraically closed: this is stated by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of [[algebraic number]]s.

Given a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, the assertion &amp;ldquo;&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed&amp;rdquo; is equivalent to each one of the following:

* Every polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, with [[coefficient]]s in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, [[Factorization|splits into linear factors]]. In other words, there are elements &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;p(x)=k(x-x_1)(x-x_2)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x-x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

* The field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has no proper [[algebraic extension]].

* For each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, every [[Linear map|linear map]] from &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; into itself has some [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]].

* Every [[Rational function|rational function]] in one variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form &lt;math&gt;a/(x-b)^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraically closed field, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; has an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, since this is the same thing as saying that the equation &lt;math&gt;x^n-a=0&lt;/math&gt; has some root in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. However, there are fields in which every element has an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root (for each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) but which are not algebraically closed. In fact, even assuming that every polynomial of the form &lt;math&gt;x^n-a&lt;/math&gt; splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.

Every field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has an &quot;[[algebraic closure]]&quot;, which is the smallest algebraically closed field of which &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a subfield.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Anatoly Karpov.jpg|thumb|right|Anatoly Karpov]]
'''Anatoli Yevgenyevich Karpov''' (Анато́лий Евге́ньевич Ка́рпов) (born [[May 23]], [[1951]]) is a [[Russia]]n [[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and former [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]]. He is the most successful tournament player of all time, and as of July 2005 he has 161 first-place finishes to his credit.  From 1978 to 1998 he played in every [[FIDE]] World Championship match. His overall professional record is 1,118 wins, 287 losses, and 1,480 draws in 3,163 games. His peak [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] is 2780.

==Grandmaster==

Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 in [[Zlatoust]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] and learned to play chess at the age of 4. At age 12 he was accepted into [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]'s prestigious chess school.  Ironically, Botvinnik had this to say about a young Karpov: &quot;The boy doesn't have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.&quot;{{fact}}  Karpov proved him wrong by becoming the youngest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] National Master in history at 15, and won in his first international chess tournament several months later. In 1967 he took 5th in the [[Soviet Junior Chess Championship]] and won the [[European Junior Chess Championship]] later that same year. In 1969 he became the first Soviet player since [[Boris Spassky]] (1955) to win the [[World Junior Chess Championship]] with a score of 10 out of 11. Soon afterwards he tied for 4th place at an international tournament in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] and became the world's youngest [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]].

==Candidate==

The 1970s showed a major improvement in his game. His [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] shot up from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he came in 2nd in the [[USSR Chess Championship]] and placed first in the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Interzonal]] Tournament. The latter qualified him for the 1974 Candidates cycle, which determined who was allowed to challenge the reigning World Champion, [[Bobby Fischer]].

Karpov beat [[Lev Polugaevsky]] by +3=5 in the first Candidates match to face former World Champion [[Boris Spassky]] in the next round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates cycle in 1977.

Most expected the Spassky-Karpov match to be a one-sided rout by the ex-champ Spassky. Although Spassky won the first game as black in good style, tenacious and aggressive play from Karpov secured him a win +4-1=6. Karpov was certainly not hurt by the fact that Spassky's chief opening analyst, 1955 [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Champion]] [[Efim Geller]], defected to Karpov's side several months before the match.

The Candidates final was against fellow Russian [[Viktor Korchnoi]], a notable fighting player. Intense games were fought, including one &quot;opening laboratory&quot; win against the [[Sicilian Defense|Sicilian Dragon]].  Karpov went 3&amp;ndash;0 up but tired towards the end and allowed Korchnoi two wins, but Karpov prevailed +3-2=19.  Thus he won the right to challenge Fischer for the World Championship.

Though the world championship match between the young Soviet prodigy and the incomparably dominant American Fischer was highly anticipated, the match never came about. Fischer drew up a list of ten demands, chief among them the provisions that draws wouldn't count, the first to ten victories wins, and if the score was tied 9&amp;ndash;9 the champion would retain the crown. This means that candidate needed two wins more than the reigning champion because narrowest possible win for him is 10&amp;ndash;8. The [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs|International Chess Federation]] (FIDE) flatly refused at first, but eventually conceded the first two. However, Fischer demanded all or nothing, and when FIDE refused to give into the third demand, Fischer resigned his crown, to the huge disappointment of the chess world. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. Fischer never did play Karpov (or [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], for that matter) and scorned them as inferior players. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without defeating the reigning champion, which lead some chess pundits to accuse Karpov of being a &quot;paper world champion&quot;&amp;mdash;that he had earned the title in a ceremony, but not over a chessboard.

When Kasparov was in a bitter struggle for the world championship with Karpov, he often reminded others that Karpov won the title by default.  But while preparing a monumental book series ''Kasparov: On My Great Predecessors'', Kasparov argued that Karpov would have had the better chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.  Critics argue that Kasparov was trying to boost his own prestige by boosting that of the man he defeated.  Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978{{fact}}.  [[Zsuzsa Polgar]] thinks Fischer would have won very narrowly in 1975 due to his greater experience.[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf]

==World champion==

Shamed that he had become the twelfth world champion in this manner, and desperately trying to prove he was worthy of the crown, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He created the most phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world the chess world had ever seen. This tournament success even eclipsed the pre-war tournament record of [[Alexander Alekhine]]. He held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (9) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14).

In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Viktor Korchnoi, the opponent he defeated in the previous Candidates tournament. The situation was vastly different from the previous match, because in the intervening years Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union. The match was played in [[Baguio]] in the [[Philippines]], and a vast array of psychological tricks were used during the match, from Karpov's Dr. Zukhar who attempted to hypnotize Korchnoi during the game, to Korchnoi's mirror glasses to ward off the hypnotic stare, Korchnoi's offering to play under the [[Jolly Roger]] flag when he was denied the right to play under [[Switzerland]]'s, to Karpov's yogurt supposedly being used to send him secret messages, to Korchnoi inviting two local cult members (on trial for [[attempted murder]]) into the hall as members of his team.

The off-board antics are better remembered than the actual chess match. Karpov took an early lead, but Korchnoi staged an amazing comeback very late in the match, and came very close to winning. Karpov narrowly won the last game to take the match 6&amp;ndash;5, with 21 draws.

Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates winner against [[Germany|German]] finalist Dr. [[Robert Huebner]] to challenge Karpov in [[Merano]], [[Italy]]. This time the psychological trick was the arrest of Korchnoi's son for evading [[conscription]]. Again the politics off the board overshadowed the games, but this time Karpov easily won (11&amp;ndash;7, +6 -2 =10) in what is remembered to be the &quot;Massacre of Merano&quot;.

Karpov's tournament career also reached a peak at the exceptional [[Montreal]] &quot;Super-Grandmaster&quot; tournament in 1979, where he ended joint first with [[Mikhail Tal]] ahead of a field of superb grandmasters like [[Jan Timman]], [[Ljubomir Ljubojevic]], [[Boris Spassky]], and [[Lubomir Kavalek]]. Meanwhile, he had also won the prestigious [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] in 1981 (and again in 1994), the [[Tilburg]] tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Championship]] in 1976 and 1983 (and again in 1988).

To illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11 -2 =20 v Spassky, +5 =12 v [[Robert Hübner]], +6 -1 = 16 v [[Ulf Andersson]], +3 -1 =10 v [[Vasily Smyslov]], +1 =16 v [[Mikhail Tal]], +10 -2 =13 v Ljubojevic.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Karkas1.jpg|thumbnail|The 1984 [[World Chess Championship]] was between [[Garry Kasparov]] (left) and Anatoly Karpov (right).]] --&gt;

Karpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion when [[Garry Kasparov]] arrived on the scene. In their first World Championship match in 1984, Karpov quickly built a 4&amp;ndash;0 lead, and needed only two more wins to keep his title. Instead, the next 17 games were drawn, and it took Karpov until Game 27 to finally win another game. In Game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, but drew the next 14. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered terribly and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov suddenly won Game 47 and 48, Karpov suffered a physical collapse, having lost 10 kg (22 lb) over the course of the match. The FIDE President controversially terminated the match, which had lasted an unprecedented four months with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and a staggering forty draws. A rematch was set for the following year. In a hard fight, Karpov lost his title 11 to 13 in the 1985 match, ending his ten-year reign as champion.

==Rival==

Karpov remained a formidable opponent for most of the [[1980s|eighties]]. He fought Kasparov in three more World Championship matches in 1986 (held in [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]), 1987 (held in [[Seville]]), and 1990 (held in [[Lyon]] and [[New York City]]). All three matches were extremely close (the scores were 12.5 to 11.5, 12 to 12, and 12.5 to 11.5). In all three matches Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game, and should have led to Karpov's winning the title. Instead, in the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov blundered on his 33rd and 64th moves and lost, ending the match in a draw and allowing Kasparov to keep the title. 

The overall game score between them stayed virtually even until the late 1990s, when the score shifted decisively towards Kasparov. Currently, in their 235 formal games played, Karpov has 23 wins, 33 losses, and an incredible 179 draws. In their five world championship matches, Karpov has 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

Although twelve years older than Kasparov, Karpov still has the stamina and endurance to be a match for Kasparov. In 2002, he defeated Kasparov in a rapid time control match 2.5-1.5. Karpov is on record saying that had he had the opportunity to fight Fischer for the crown like Kasparov had the opportunity to fight him, he (Karpov) could have been a much better player as a result. Though the struggle for the world championship made them enemies, Karpov and Kasparov maintain a tremendous level of respect for each other{{fact}}. The two of them and their titanic struggles make up a chess rivalry that even surpassed that of [[Capablanca]] and [[Alekhine]].

==FIDE Champion again==

It came as a surprise, then, that Karpov lost a Candidates Match against [[Nigel Short]] in 1992. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov crushed [[Jan Timman]]&amp;mdash;the loser of the Candidates final against Short. Once again he had become World Champion, and once again he did so controversially. He defended his title against [[Gata Kamsky]] (+6 -3 =9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidate Matches, instead having a large knock-out event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating [[Viswanathan Anand]] (+4 -2 =2). But subsequently the champion had to qualify like other players. Karpov resigned his title in anger at the new rules in 1999, so the winner of the 1999 tournament ([[Alexander Khalifman]]) became FIDE World Champion.

However, the FIDE champions were not recognized as such by the general public. The fact that the FIDE champions were regularly crushed by Kasparov in tournaments testified to his dominance. The FIDE matches received little public attention, while Kasparov's matches with the PCA and subsequently Braingames were widely reported in the media. For more details about these series of champions, see the [[World Chess Championship]] article.

==Towards Retirement?==

In 1991 Karpov temporarily dropped to third in the FIDE ranking list, the first time since 1971. Though he quickly recovered, many said that Karpov had lost his edge, and that his playing level had declined. However, Karpov bounced back against the world's very strongest players (in the order of their finish, [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], [[Alexei Shirov|Shirov]], [[Evgeny Bareev|Bareev]], [[Vladimir Kramnik|Kramnik]], [[Joel Lautier|Lautier]], [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]], [[Gata Kamsky|Kamsky]], [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]], [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Boris Gelfand|Gelfand]], [[Miguel Illescas|Illescas]], [[Judit Polgar]], and [[Alexander Beliavsky|Beliavsky]]) in the landmark &quot;super-strong&quot; tournament [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] 1994 (average [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] 2685, the highest in history, meaning it was the first Category XVIII tournament ever held).

Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightfully be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the chess of his life and dramatically won the tournament. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage in 64 years), dominating second-place Kasparov and Shirov by a huge 2.5 points. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov, detailed below, is considered possibly his finest throughout his career).  This performance against the best players in the world put his [[ELO rating system|ELO rating]] tournament performance at 2985, the highest performance rating of any chess player in any tournament in all of chess history. 

Even recently, few players have surpassed Karpov's achievements. Since he dropped out of the top three players in the world on the FIDE rankings, only [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Viswanathan Anand]], [[Vladimir Kramnik]], and (as of January 2005) [[Veselin Topalov]] have been in the top three slots. In other words, Karpov is the last person to have been in the top three in the world before Kasparov, Anand, Kramnik, and Topalov. In addition, Karpov is the only player among these to ever have ranked number one in the world ahead of Kasparov.

However, Karpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1995, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the [[Supreme Soviet]] Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union broke up. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the October 2005 FIDE rating list, he is 33rd in the world with an ELO rating of 2672.

However, more recently, because of his traditional strength at managing his thinking time, Karpov has instead begun revamping his style to specialize in rapid chess.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Auto racing''' (also known as '''automobile racing''', '''autosport''' or '''motorsport''') is a [[sport]] involving [[racing]] [[automobile]]s.  '''Motor racing''' or '''motorsport''' may also mean [[motorcycle racing]], and can include [[motorboat racing]] and [[air racing]]. It is one of the world's most popular [[spectator sport]]s and perhaps the most thoroughly [[commercialization|commercialized]].

== History ==
=== The Start===
Auto racing began almost immediately after the construction of the first successful [[gasoline|petrol]]-fuelled autos. In [[1894]], the first contest was organized by Paris magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'', a reliability test  to determine best performance.

A year later the first real race was staged, from [[Paris]], [[France]] to [[Bordeaux]], France. First over the line was [[Émile Levassor]] but he was disqualified because his car was not a required four-seater. 

An international competition began with the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing]].

The first auto race in the [[United States]], over a 54.36 mile (87.48 km) course, took place in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on [[November 2]], [[1895]], [[Frank Duryea]] winning in 10 h and 23 min, beating three petrol-fuelled cars and two electric. The first trophy awarded was the [[Vanderbilt Cup]].

=== City to city racing ===
[[Image:Mors.jpg||thumb|340px|Fernand Gabriel driving a Mors in Paris-Madrid 1903]]
With auto construction and racing dominated by [[France]], the French automobile club  ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city in Europe or France.

These very successful races ended in [[1903]] when Marcel [[Renault]] was involved in a fatal accident near [[Angouleme]] in the Paris-Madrid race. Eight fatalities caused the French government to stop the race in [[Bordeaux]] and ban open-road racing.
&lt;!-- (much more on this) --&gt;

===1910-1950===
The [[1930s]] saw the radical differentiation of racing vehicles from high-priced road cars, with [[Delage]], [[Auto Union]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Delahaye]] and [[Bugatti]] constructing streamlined vehicles with engines producing up to 450 kW(612HP) with the aid of multiple superchargers. From [[1928]]-[[1930]] and again in [[1934]]-[[1936]], the maximum [[weight]] permitted was 750 kg(1654Lbs), a rule diametrically opposed to current racing regulations. Extensive use of aluminium alloys was required to achieve light weight, and in the case of the Mercedes, the paint was removed to satisfy the weight limitation, producing the famous [[Silver Arrows]].

:''See: [[Grand Prix motor racing]]''

== Categories ==
There are many categories of auto racing.

=== Single-seater racing ===
:''Main article: [[Open wheel racing]]''
[[Image:formula_one_car.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A modern Formula One car]]
Single-seater ([[open-wheel]]) racing is perhaps the most well-known form of motorsport, with cars designed specifically for high-speed racing. The wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce downforce and enhance adhesion to the track.

Single-seater races are held on specially designed closed circuits or  street circuits closed for the event. Many single-seater races in North America are held on &quot;oval&quot; circuits and the [[Indy Racing League]] races mostly on ovals.

The best-known variety of single-seater racing is the [[Formula One]] World Championship, which involves an annual championship featuring major international car and engine manufacturers in an ongoing battle of technology and driver skill. Formula One is, by any measure, the most expensive sport in the world, with some teams spending in excess of 201 million US dollars per year. Formula One is widely considered to be the pinnacle of motorsports, and a seat in a Formula One car is undoubtedly the peak of any driver's racing career. In North America, the cars used in the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]] (currently [[Champcars]] and the [[Indy Racing League]]) have traditionally been similar to [[F1 cars]] but with more restrictions on technology aimed at helping to control costs.

Other single-seater racing series are [[GP2 Series|GP2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[Formula Two]]), [[Formula Nippon]], [[Formula Nissan]] (also known as the Telefonica World Series), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Atlantic]], and [[A1 Grand Prix]].

There are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of today's top drivers started their careers in karts.

=== Rallying ===
:''Main article: [[Rallying]]''
[[Rallying]], or rally racing,  involves highly modified production cars on (closed) public roads or off-road areas run on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers “rally” to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of stages of any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand. The co-driver uses the &quot;pacenotes&quot; to help the driver complete each stage as fast as possible, reading the detailed shorthand aloud over an in-car intercom system. Competition is based on lowest total elasped time over the course of an event.

The top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), but there also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and [[Rally Argentina]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a &quot;[[rally raid]]&quot;) is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]]. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]] which are popular with amateurs, making up the &quot;grass roots&quot; of motorsports.

=== Ice Racing ===
:''Main article: [[Ice Racing]]''

=== Touring car racing===
:''Main article: [[Touring car racing]]''
[[Image:11_murphy_leads.jpg|left|170px|thumb|V8 Supercar Touring car racing]]
Touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived race cars. It often features exciting, full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.

The [[V8 Supercars]] originally from [[Australia]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] originally from [[Germany]], and the [[World Touring Car Championship]] held with 2 non-European races (previously the [[European Touring Car Championship]]) are the major touring car championships conducted worldwide. 

The [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America while the venerable [[British Touring Car Championship]] continues in [[Great Britain]]. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S.  The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits.

===Stock car racing===
[[Image:Riverside_Raceway.JPG|thumb|250px|right|One of the most famous NASCAR tracks was the old [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]].]]

:''Main article: [[Stock car racing]]''
[[Stock car racing]] is the American variant of touring car racing. Usually conducted on ovals, the cars look like production cars but are in fact purpose-built racing machines which are all very similar in specifications. Early stock cars were much closer to production vehicles; the car to be raced was often driven from track to track.

The main stock car racing series is [[NASCAR]]  and among the most famous races in the series are the [[Daytona 500]] and [[Allstate 400 at The Brickyard]]. NASCAR also runs the [[Busch Series]] (a junior stock car league) and the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] ([[pickup truck]]s). 

NASCAR also runs the [[Featherlite]] series of &quot;modified&quot; cars which are heavily modified from stock form.  With powerful engines, large tires, and light bodies. NASCAR's oldest series is considered by many to be its most exciting.

There are also other stock car series like [[IROC]] in the United States and [[CASCAR]] in [[Canada]].

[[British Stock car racing]] is a form of Short Oval Racing 
This takes place on Shale or Tarmac tracks in either Clockwise or Anti-Clockwise direction, Depending on the class some of which are contact.

Races are organised by local promoters and all drivers are registered with BRISCA and have their own race number.

What classes exist depends on the promoters, so events in [[Scotland]] at Cowdenbeath can be very different from an event at [[Wimbledon Stadium]] in [[London]].

''Formula Cars''
* F1 - Cars built to Specification normally utilising 5,6 or 7 Litre V8 engines
* F2 - Specification built cars similar to F1 with 2 Litre Ford Pinto Engines
These are the two main National forms of British Stock Car Racing, there are World Championships organised by the governing body [http://www.brisca.com/BRISCA]

There are also local variants raced in some smaller tracks, they are usually similar to F2 Stock Cars.

F1's race (in the UK) at the following venues:

Belle Vue Stadium (Manchester),
Owlerton Stadium (Sheffield),
Skegness Stadium,
Buxton,
Hednesford,
Birmingham,
Northampton,
Coventry,
Kings Lynn,
Ipswich,
Cowdenbeath,
Knockhill.

They also race in Holland.

''Hot Rods''
* Local Variations on the concept of fibreglass cars that look like production models Non Contact

''Production Models''
*Modified Road cars, classes range from Non-Contact 2 Litre Hot Rods to Contact Banger Racing.

Contact Classes can be identified by the inclusion of external side impact bars and large bumpers at either end made out of square section steel.

===Drag racing===
:''Main article: [[Drag racing]]''
In [[drag racing]], the objective is to complete a certain distance, traditionally 1/4 mile, (400 m), in the shortest possible time. The vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. A street car can cover the 1/4 mile (400 m) in 15 s whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] can cover the same distance in 4.5 s and reach 330 mph (530 km/h).  Drag racing was organised as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early [[1950s]] through the [[NHRA]] (National Hot Rod Association) which is the largest sanctioning motor sports body in the world. The NHRA was formed to prevent people from [[street racing]]. Illegal street racing is not drag racing.

Launching its run to 330 mph (530 km/h), a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 4.5 ''[[Gee|g]]'' (44 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and when braking and parachutes are deployed, the driver experiences deceleration of 4 ''g'' (39 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), more than space shuttle occupants. A single top fuel car can be heard over eight miles (13 km) away and can generate a reading of 1.5 to 2 on the [[Richter scale]]. (NHRA Mile High Nationals 2001, and 2002 testing from the National Seismology Center.)

Drag racing is often head-to-head where two cars battle each other, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a head start) using an index, and cars running faster than their index &quot;break out&quot; and lose.

Drag racing is mostly popular in the [[United States]].

===Sports car racing===
:''Main article: [[Sports car racing]]''
In [[sports car racing]], production versions of sports cars and purpose-built prototype cars compete with each other on closed circuits. The races are usually conducted over long distances, at least 1000 km, and cars are driven by teams of two or three drivers (and sometimes more in the US), switching every now and then. Due to the performance difference between production based sports cars and sports racing prototypes, one race usually involves many racing classes. In the US the [[American Le Mans]] Series was organized in 1999, featuring GT, GTS, and two prototype classes. Another series based on Le Mans began in 2004, the [[Le Mans Endurance Series]], which included four 1000 km races at tracks in Europe. A competing body, [[Grand-Am]], which began in 2000, sanctions its own set of endurance series, the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and the [[Grand-Am Cup]]. Grand-Am events typically feature many more cars and much closer competition than American Le Mans.

Famous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]].

===Offroad racing===
:''Main article: [[Offroad racing]]''
In [[offroad racing]], various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]].
In Europe, &quot;offroad&quot; refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], [[Master Rallye]] or European &quot;bajas&quot; are called Cross-Country Rallies.

===Hillclimbing===
:''Main article: [[Hillclimbing]]''

===Kart racing===
:''Main article: [[Kart racing]]''
Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economic way to try your luck at motorsport and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. World-famous F1-drivers like [[Michael Schumacher|Michael]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]] and most of the typical starting grid of a modern Grand Prix took up the sport at around the age of eight, with some testing from age three. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to go racing, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.

Go-karts, or just &quot;karts&quot; - seem very distant from normal road cars, with dimunitive frames and wheels, but a small engine combined with very light weight make for a quick machine. The tracks are also on a much smaller scale, making kart racing more accessible to the people.

==Use of flags==
''Main article: [[Racing flags]]''

In open-wheel, stock-car and other types of circuit auto races, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of a race and to communicate instructions to competitors in a race. While the flags have changed from the first years (e.g. red used to start a race), these are generally accepted for today.

{|
! Flag
! Displayed from start tower
! Displayed from observation post

|End of hazardous section of track.
|-
|[[Image:Auto Racing Yellow.svg|25px|Yellow flag]]
|Full course caution condition for ovals. On road courses, it means a local area of caution. Depending on the type of racing, either two yellow flags will be used for a full course caution or a sign with 'SC' ([[Safety car]]) will be used as the field follows the [[pace car|pace/safety car]] on track and no cars may pass.
|Local caution condition — no cars may pass at the particular corner where being displayed.

{{Libertarianism}}

'''Anarcho-capitalism''' (aka '''free market anarchism''') is a [[philosophy]] based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]],  and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]].  It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals.  From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[state]] as an unjustified monopolist and systematic aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through [[taxation]], with private, competing businesses that use physical force only in defense of liberty and property against aggressors. Hence, they believe that all goods and services, including law, order, and security, should be supplied through the mechanism of a [[free market]].

The philosophy embraces [[anti-statism|stateless]] capitalism as one of its foundational principles. The first well-known version of anarcho-capitalism to identify itself thus was developed by economists of the [[Austrian School]] and [[libertarians]] [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Walter Block]] in the mid-20th century, synthesizing elements from Austrian School [[economics]], [[classical liberalism]] and [[19th century|19th-century]] [[American individualist anarchism]]. While Rothbard bases his philosophy on [[natural law]], others, such as [[David Friedman]], take a pragmatic [[consequentialist]] approach by arguing that anarcho-capitalism should be implemented because such a system would have consequences superior to alternatives. 

Because of this embrace of capitalism, there is considerable tension between anarcho-capitalists and [[anarchist]]s who see the [[anti-capitalism|rejection of capitalism]] as being just as essential to anarch
