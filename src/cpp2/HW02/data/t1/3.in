'''Anime''' (アニメ) is a style of [[animated cartoon|cartoon animation]] originating in [[Japan]]. Anime is characterized by character and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers. Storylines may feature a variety of [[Fictional character|characters]] and may be set in different locations and in different eras. Anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different [[genre]]s that any series may be categorised under. Anime may be broadcast on [[television]], distributed on media, such as [[DVD]]s, or published as [[console]] and [[computer]] [[games]]. Anime is often influenced by Japanese [[comics]] known as [[manga]]. Anime may also be adapted into [[live action]] television programs.

{{main|History of anime}}
The '''history of [[anime]]''' begins at the start of the 20th century, when [[Japan]]ese [[filmmaker]]s experimented with the [[animation]] techniques that were being explored in the West. During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing unique genres such as [[mecha]]. In the 1980s, anime was accepted in the [[mainstream]] in Japan, and experienced a [[boom]] in production. The 1990s and 2000s saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets.

==Terminology==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for animation is アニメーション
(''animēshon'', pronounced: {{IPA|/ɑnimɛːʃɔn/}}), written in [[katakana]]. It is a direct [[transliteration]] and reborrowed [[loanword]] of the English term &quot;[[animation]].&quot; The Japanese term is abbreviated as アニメ (''anime'', pronounced: {{IPA|/ɑnimɛ/}} ). Both the original and abbreviated forms are valid and interchangeable in Japanese, but as could be expected the abbreviated form is more commonly used. The term is a broad one, and does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style.

'''Pronunciation'''

The [[English language|English]] word ''anime'' is a [[transliteration]] of the abbreviated version of this Japanese term, and it is typically pronounced as {{IPA|/ˈænɪˌmei/}}, or &quot;ANN ih may&quot; (&quot;AH nee may&quot; is a less common variant). 

Some theorize the word comes from the [[French language|French]] ''animé'' (&quot;animated&quot;) or &quot;les dessins animés&quot; (animated drawings) and pronounce it as &quot;ah nee MAY&quot;, though the Japanese themselves deny this theory, and the fact that it is written in Japanese syllables as アニメ (''anime'') rather than アニメイ (''animei'') further lowers its credibility.

As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[Pokémon]]'' and [[Kobo Abe|Kobo Abé]], ''anime'' is sometimes spelled as ''animé'' in English with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'' to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as {{IPA|[e]}}. Hence, the pronunciations &quot;ah NEEM&quot; and &quot;uh NEEM&quot; are generally considered incorrect.

'''Syntax'''

''Anime'' can be used as a common [[noun]], ''&quot;Do you watch anime?&quot;'' or as a suppletive [[adjective]], ''&quot;The anime Guyver is different from the movie Guyver.&quot;'' It may also be used as a [[mass noun]], as in ''&quot;How much anime have you collected?&quot;'' and therefore is never pluralized &quot;animes&quot; (nouns are never pluralized in Japanese).

'''Synonyms'''

Anime is sometimes referred to by the [[blend (linguistics)|blend word]] '''Japanimation''', but this term has fallen into disuse. It saw the most usage during the 1970s and 1980s, which broadly comprise the first and second waves of anime [[fandom]]. The term survived at least into the early 1990s but seemed to fade away shortly before the mid-1990s anime resurgence. In general, the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts. The term is much more commonly used within Japan to refer to domestic animation. Since ''anime'' or ''animēshon'' is used to describe all forms of animation, ''Japanimation'' is used to distinguish Japanese work from that of the rest of the world.

In more recent years, anime has also frequently been referred to as ''manga'' in Europe, a practice that may stem from the Japanese usage: In Japan, ''[[manga]]'' can refer to both animation and comics (although the use of ''manga'' to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non-fans). Among English speakers, ''manga'' usually has the stricter meaning of &quot;Japanese comics&quot;. An alternate explanation is that it is due to the prominence of [[Manga Entertainment]], a distributor of anime to the US and UK markets; because Manga Entertainment started out in the UK, this use of the term is much more common in Europe.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Dragonballz.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Dragon Ball Z]] is one of the most popular [[shōnen]] anime.]]

Anime features a wide variety of artistic styles which vary from artist to artist and is characterized by stark, colorful graphics and stylized, colorful images depicting vibrant characters in a variety of different settings and storylines, aimed at a wide range of audiences. 

===Genres===
Anime has many genres, with as many as traditional, [[live action]] cinema. Such genres include adventure, [[science fiction]], children's stories, [[Romantic love|romance]], medieval [[fantasy]], [[erotica]] ([[hentai]]), occult/horror, action, and [[drama]]. 

Most anime includes content from several different genres, as well as a variety of thematic elements. This can make categorizing some titles very difficult. A show may have a seemingly simple surface plot, but at the same time may feature a far more complex, deeper storyline and character development. It is not uncommon for a strongly action themed anime to also involve humor, romance, and even poignant [[social commentary]]. The same can be applied to a romance themed anime in that it may involve a strong action element.

Genres and designations that are specific to anime and manga:
:''(For other possible genres, see [[list of movie genres]].)''
*[[Bishōjo]]: Japanese for 'beautiful girl', blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty girl characters, for example ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]''
*[[Bishōnen]]: Japanese for 'beautiful boy' blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features &quot;pretty&quot; and elegant boys and men, for example ''[[Fushigi Yūgi]]''
*[[Ecchi]]: Japanese for 'indecent sexuality'. Contains mild sexual humor, for example ''[[Love Hina]]''.
*[[Hentai]]: Japanese for 'abnormal' or 'perverted', and used by Western Audiences to refer to pornographic anime or [[erotica]]. However, in Japan the term used to refer to the same material is typically ''Poruno'' or ''Ero''.
*[[Josei]]: Japanese for 'young woman', this is anime or manga that is aimed at young women, and is one of the rarest forms.
*[[Kodomo]]: Japanese for 'child', this is anime or manga that is aimed at young children, for example ''[[Doraemon]]''.
*[[Mecha]]: Anime or manga featuring giant robots, example ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''.
*[[Moé]]: Anime or manga featuring characters that are extremely perky or cute, for example ''[[Little Snow Fairy Sugar]]''.
*[[progressive anime|Progressive]]: &quot;Art films&quot; or extremely stylized anime, for example ''[[Voices of a Distant Star]]''.
*[[Seinen]]: Anime or manga similar to Shōnen, but targeted at teenage or young male adults, for example ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]''.
*[[Super Sentai|Sentai/Super Sentai]]: Literally &quot;fighting team&quot; in Japanese, refers to any show that involves a superhero team, for example ''[[Cyborg 009]]''.
*[[Shōjo]]: Japanese for 'young lady' or 'little girl', refers to anime or manga targeted at girls, for example ''[[Fruits Basket]]''.
**[[Magical girl|Mahō Shōjo]]: Subgenre of Shoujo known for 'Magical Girl' stories, for example ''[[Sailor Moon]]''.
*[[Shōjo-ai]]: Japanese for 'girl-love', refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between female characters, for example ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''.
*[[Shōnen]]: Japanese for 'boys', refers to anime or manga targeted at boys, for example ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''.
*[[Shōnen-ai]]: Japanese for 'boy-love', refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between male characters. This term is being phased out in Japan due to references to [[pedophilia]], and is being replaced by the term &quot;Boys Love&quot; (BL). An example of this style is ''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]''.

Some anime titles are written for a very specific audience, even narrower than those described above.  For example, ''[[Initial D]]'' and ''[[EX-Driver|éX-Driver]]'' concern [[street racing]] and car tuning.  ''[[Ashita No Joe]]'' is about [[boxing]].  ''[[Hanaukyo Maid Team]]'' is based on the [[French maid]] fantasy.

Recently, the ''National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of Canada'' has incorrectly classified all anime as [[hentai]], giving an improper impression of the content of most anime and manga series. This occurred despite having linked to this Wikipedia page in order to establish a definition of terms. The site can be viewed at the following link: [http://ncecc.ca/fact_sheets/anime_e.htm]. Complaints about the article's content and improper citations caused the NCECC to revise the citations but not the content.

===Music===
Much like western live-action cinema, anime uses music as an important artistic tool. Anime soundtracks are big business in Japan, and are often times met with similar demand as [[chart-topper|chart topping]] pop albums. It is for this reason that anime music is often composed and performed by 'A-list' musicians, stars, and composers. Skilled BGM composers are highly respected in the anime fan community. Anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show. 

The most frequent use of music in Anime is ''background music'' or ''BGM''. BGM is used to set the tone of a given scene, for example ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' 's &quot;Decisive Battle&quot; is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow. 

The theme song (also referred to as the Opening song or abbreviated as OP) usually matches the overall tone of the show, and serves to get the viewer excited about the upcoming program. Insert songs and ending songs (abbr. ED) often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole, and are often times used to highlight a particularly important scene. Opening and ending themes, as well as insert songs, are frequently performed by popular musicians or Japanese [[japanese idol|idols]], so in this way, songs become a very important component of an anime program. In addition to the themes, the seiyū for a specific anime also frequently releases CD for their character, called Image Albums. Despite the word &quot;image&quot; in the CD's name, it only contains music and/or &quot;voice messages&quot; (where the seiyū talks with the audience or about herself), making the listener think that the character him/herself is singing. Another type of Anime CDs release are Drama CD, featuring songs and tracks which makes use of the seiyū to tell a story, often not included in the main anime.

==Animation style==
[[Image:Lum-Uresei-Yatsura.png|thumb|250px|right|Lum from ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', an iconic anime character.]]

The drawing style used in anime is counter productive to the animation process, having far too many details and subsequently making it difficult to keep the number of drawings comparable to other cartoons with design ethics that stress simplicity. This may be due to a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many.

[[Osamu Tezuka]] adapted and simplified many [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production, though it should be noted that Disney films made in the west are not anime. This was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff. Anime studios have since perfected techniques to draw as little new animation as possible, using scrolling or repeating backgrounds, still shots of characters sliding across the screen, and dialogue which involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely still, a technique not wholly unfamiliar to Western animation. The overall effect of these techniques, such as reduced [[frame rate]], several still shots and scrolling backgrounds, has led some critics to accuse anime of choppiness or poor quality in general. ''(See also [[limited animation]].)''

There are often scenes where the frame rate of the animation far exceeds the quality of the rest of the production. These are commonly referred to as &quot;money shots&quot; outside of Japan, where more effort is put into the animation of one scene to give it emphasis over the rest of the work. Animator [[Yasuo Otsuka]] was the pioneer of this technique.

Exceptions to these rules are early classic films, such as those produced by [[Toei Animation]] up until the mid 1960s, and recent big budget films, such as those produced by the enormously successful [[Studio Ghibli]]. These movies have much higher production values, due to their anticipated success at the box office. Some animators in Japan overcome production values by utilizing different techniques than the Disney or the old Tezuka/Otsuka methods of animating anime.  Directors such as [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]] (''[[Cutey Honey]]'', ''[[Dead Leaves]]'') simplify backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation. Other animators like Tatsuyuki Tanaka (in [[Koji Minamoto]]'s ''Eternal Family'' in particular) use [[squash and stretch]], an animation technique not often used by Japanese animators; Tanaka makes other shortcuts to compensate for this. Some higher-budgeted television and OVA ([[Original Video Animation]]) series also forego the shortcuts found in most other anime.

While different titles and different artists have their own unique artistic styles, many stylistic elements have become extremely common. Some examples have become so common that they are often described as being definitive of anime in general, and have been given names of their own. The most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters, common mainly due to the influence of [[Osamu Tezuka]], who was inspired by the exaggerated features of Western cartoon characters such as [[Betty Boop]] and [[Mickey Mouse]] and from Disney's ''[[Bambi]]''. Tezuka found that large eyes allowed his characters to better express their emotions. Some Western audiences have interpreted such stylized eyes as more Caucasian. Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive them as inherently more or less foreign. {{ref|refbot.15}} When Tezuka began drawing ''[[Princess Knight|Ribbon no Kishi]]'', the first manga specifically targeted at young girls, Tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters' eyes. Indeed, through ''Ribbon no Kishi'', Tezuka set a stylistic template that later ''shōjo'' artists tended to follow. Another variation of this style is &quot;[[chibi]]&quot; or &quot;[[super deformed]]&quot;; which usually feature huge eyes, an enlarged head, and small body.

Other stylistic elements are common as well; often in comedic anime, characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a &quot;face fault&quot;, in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression. Angry characters may exhibit a &quot;vein&quot; or &quot;stressmark&quot; effect, where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead. Angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike someone with it, leading to the concept of [[Hammerspace]]. Male characters will develop a [[bloody nose]] around their female love interests (typically to indicate arousal) -- this is supposedly due to blood rushing to the face in an exaggerated blush. Embarrassed characters will invariably produce a massive [[sweat-drop]], which has become something of a stereotype of anime.

The degree of stylization varies from title to title.  Some titles make extensive use of common stylization: ''[[FLCL]]'', for example, is known for its wild, exaggerated, stylization. In contrast, titles such as ''[[Only Yesterday]]'', a film by [[Isao Takahata]], take a much more realistic approach, and feature no stylistic exaggerations.

Another unique aspect of anime not found in other commercial animation markets is the lack of a directoral system. In most animation produced around the world animators are all forced to conform to a set style by the director or animation director. In Japan starting with the animation director [[Yoshinori Kanada]] (as a means to save time and money) each animator brings his/her own style to the work. The most extreme examples of this can be found in ''[[Mindgame]]'' or ''[[The Hakkenden]]''. ''The Hakkenden'' is particularly extreme, showing constantly shifting styles of animation based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode.  This approach combined with Otsuka's &quot;money shots&quot; make key animators important individuals in the style and production of an anime film.

Many non-Japanese cartoons are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime's tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs.

==Production types of anime==
Most anime can be categorized as one of three types:

*'''Films''', which are generally released in theaters, represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality. Popular anime movies include ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]],'' ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and ''[[Spirited Away]]''. Some anime [[film]]s are only released at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values. Some examples of these are ''[[Winter Days]]'', and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Legend of the Forest]]''. Other types of films include [[compilation movie]]s, which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons, and are hence a concentrated form of a television [[serial]]. These may, however, be longer than the average movie. There are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in Japanese theaters together to form feature-length showing. 

*'''Television series''' anime is [[Television syndication|syndicated]] and broadcast on television on a regular schedule. [[Television program|Television series]] are generally low quality compared to OVA ([[Original Video Animation]]) and film titles, because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a short series. Most episodes are about 23 minutes in length, to fill a typical thirty-minute time slot with added [[Television commercial|commercials]]. One full season is 26 episodes, and many titles run half seasons, or 13 episodes. Most TV series anime episodes will have [[opening credits]], [[closing credits]], and often an &quot;[[eyecatch]]&quot;, a very short scene, often humorous or silly, that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break (as &quot;bumpers&quot; in the United States are used in a similar fashion). &quot;Eyecatch&quot; scenes are often found in TV series anime and are generally similar throughout the series.  

*'''OVA''' ('''[[Original Video Animation]]'''; sometimes  '''OAV''', or '''Original Animated Video''') anime is often similar to a television [[miniseries]]. OVAs are typically two to twenty episodes in length; [[one-shot]]s are particularly short, usually less than film-length. They are most commonly released directly to video. As a general rule OVA anime tends to be of high quality, approaching that of films.  Titles often have a very regular, continuous plot best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence. Popular OVA titles include ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'', and ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]''. Opening credits, closing credits, and eyecatches may sometimes be found in OVA releases, but not universally.

'''Franchising'''

It is very common for one title to spawn several different releases.  A title that starts as a popular television series might then have a movie produced at a later date. A good example is ''Tenchi Muyo!''. Originally an OVA, it spawned three movies, three television series, and several spinoff titles and specials.

Not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story. Prequels and alternate stories are commonly adapted from the original.

==Licensing and distribution==
Anime is available outside of Japan in localized form. Licensed anime is modified by [[Western world|Western]] distributors through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] into the language of the country. The anime may also be [[edited movie|edited]] to alter cultural references that may not be understood by a non-Japanese person and companies may remove what may be perceived as objectionable content. For the fans who may object to the editing and dubbing of anime, DVDs may be their preference. DVD releases often include both the dubbed audio and the original Japanese audio with [[subtitle]]s, are typically unedited, and lack [[Television commercial|commercial]]s.

'''Fansubs'''

Although it is a violation of [[copyright]] laws in many countries, some fans watch [[fansub]]s, recordings of anime series that have been subtitled by fans. Watching subtitled Japanese versions is usually seen as the intended method of watching anime by enthusiasts. The ethical implications of producing, distributing, or watching fansubs is a topic of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from and cease distribution of their work once the series has been licensed.

'''Ankara''' is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Turkey]] and the country's second largest city after [[İstanbul]]. The city has a population of 4,319,167 (Provience 5,153,000) ([[as of 2005]]), and a mean elevation of 850 m. (2800 ft.) It was formerly known as '''[[Angora]]''' or '''Engürü''', and in Roman times as '''Ancyra''', and in classical and Hellenistic periods as Ἄγκυρα '''Áŋkyra'''.

It is also the capital of [[Ankara Province]].

Centrally located in [[Anatolia]], Ankara is an important commercial and industrial city. It is the center of the Turkish Government, and houses all foreign embassies. It is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the center of Turkey's highway and rail network, and serves as the marketing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The city was famous for its long-haired goat and its wool ([[Angora wool]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Ankara cat]]), white [[rabbits]], [[pear]], [[honey]], and the region's [[Muscat grape|muscat]] [[grapes]].

Ankara is situated upon a steep and rocky hill, which rises 500 ft. above the plain on the left bank of the ''Enguri Su'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. The city is located 39&amp;deg;52'30&quot; North, 32&amp;deg;52' East (39.875, 32.8333). The city, which is one of the driest places in Turkey and surrounded by a barren featureless steppe vegetation, with various [[Hittite]], [[Phrygian]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[archeological site]]s. It has a harsh dry [[continental climate]] with cold snowy winters and hot dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during spring and autumn. 

The hill is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which add to the picturesqueness of the view; but the town was not well built, many of its houses constructed of sun-dried mud bricks along narrow streets. &lt;sup&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html]&lt;/sup&gt;  There are, however, many finely preserved remains of [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], the most remarkable being the temple of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], on the walls of which is the famous ''Monumentum Ancyranum''&lt;sup&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:A Turkish Kaleidoscope (1926)- Ankara Bazaar.png|left|thumb|300px|Ankara Bazaar in [[1920s]].]]
The region's vibrant history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hatti]] civilization, which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites|Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygians]], then by the [[Lydians]] and [[Persia|Persians]]. 

Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]]. In [[333 BC]], Alexander came from [[Gordium]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a period of time. After his death at [[Babylon]] in [[323 BC]] and the subsequent division of his empire amongst his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]]. 

In [[278 BC]], Ankara was occupied by the [[Gaul|Gaulish]] race of [[Galatia|Galatians]] who were the first to make Ankara their capital. It was then known as '''Ancyra''', meaning &quot;[[anchor]]&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Ankara's organized and written history starts with the [[Galatia|Galatians]].

[[Image:Ulus_Ankara.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A view from Ulus, the historical district of Ankara.]]
The city subsequently fell to the [[Roman Empire]] in [[189 BC]] and became the capital of the Roman province of [[Galatia]]. Under Roman rule, Ankara became a gate to the east for Rome, and as such was well developed, achieving the status of &quot;city-state&quot; or [[polis]]. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] reign, even after its capital was moved to [[Constantinople]]. Although Ankara fell into the hands of several Arab armies numerous times after the 6th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century.

In [[1071]] [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan|Alparslan]] threw open the door to Anatolia for the Turks by his victory at [[Battle of Manzikert|Malazgirt]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and natural resources, to Turkish territory in [[1073]]. [[Orhan I]], second &quot;bey&quot; of the [[Ottoman Empire]] captured the city in [[1356]]. Another [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] leader, [[Timur Lenk]] besieged Ankara as part of his campaign in [[Anatolia]], but in [[1403]] Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

At the close of [[World War I]], Turkey was under the control of the Ottoman sultan and having lost the war, was being shared by [[Greece|Greeks]], [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Italy|Italians]]. The leader of the Turkish nationalists, [[Kemal Atatürk]] established the headquarters of his resistance movement in Ankara in [[1919]] (See [[Treaty of Sèvres]] and [[Turkish War of Independence]]). After the War of Independence was won and the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, Turkey was declared a [[republic]] on [[October 29]], [[1923]], Ankara having replaced [[İstanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]) as the capital of the new [[Republic of Turkey]] on [[October 13]], [[1923]].

[[Image:Kizilay_Ankara.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A recent view from Kızılay, the central district of Ankara.]]
After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called '''Ulus''', and a new section, called '''Yenişehir'''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered around '''Kızılay''', has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section.

===Archeological sites===

[[Image:Ankara Citadel2.MarkHamilto.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ankara Citadel.]]
'''Ankara Citadel''': The foundations of the citadel were laid by the Galatians on a prominent [[lava]] outcrop, and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine, music and of course, [[Raki]].

'''Roman Theatre''': The remains, the stage, and the backstage, can be seen outside the castle. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations (see above). The seating area is still under excavation. 

'''Temple of Augustus''': It was built by the Galatian King [[Pylamenes]] in [[AD 10]] as a tribute and sign of fidelity to [[Augustus]], and was reconstructed by the Romans on the ancient Ankara Acropolis in the 2nd century. It is important for the &quot;Monument Ancyranum&quot;, the sole surviving political testament of Augustus, detailing his achievements inscribed on its walls in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In the fifth century the temple was converted into a church by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. The temple is in the Ulus quarter of the city.

'''Roman Bath''': This bath has all the typical features of a classical [[Roman bath]]: a frigidarium (cold room), tepidarium (cool room) and caldarium (hot room). The bath was built in the reign of Emperor [[Caracalla|Caracalla]] in 3rd century AD to honour the [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine. Today only the basement and first floors remain. Situated in Ulus quarter.

'''Column of Julian''': This column, in Ulus, was erected in AD 362, to commemorate a visit by the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. It stands fifteen meters high and has a typical leaf decoration on the capital.

===Modern monuments===

===Mosques===
[[Image:Kocatepe Mosque Ankara.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Kocatepe Mosque]]

'''Kocatepe Mosque''': This mosque was constructed in the late 20th century in accordance with classical Ottoman models, which emphasize the placement of four minarets. Its size and prominent location make it a landmark that can be seen from most anywhere in central Ankara.

'''[[Haci Bayram]] [[Mosque]]''': This mosque, in Ulus quarter next to the Temple of Augustus, was built in the early 15th century in Seljuk style and was subsequently restored by architect [[Sinan]] in the 16th century, with Kutahya tiles being added in the 18th century. The mosque was built in honor of Haci Bayram Veli, whose tomb is next to the mosque.

'''Atatürk Farm and Zoo (''Atatürk Orman Çiftliği, AOÇ'')''' is an expansive recreational farming area housing a [[zoo]], several small agricultural farms, [[greenhouse]]s, restaurants, a [[Dairy farming|dairy farm]] and a [[brewery]]. It is a pleasant place to spend a day with family, be it for having picnics, hiking, biking or simply enjoying good food and nature. There is also an exact replica of the house where Atatürk was born in [[1881]], in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]]. Visitors to the &quot;Çiftlik&quot; (farm) as it is affectionately called by Ankarans, can sample such famous products of the farm as its excellent old-fashioned beer and ice cream, fresh dairy products and meat rolls/kebaps made on charcoal, through an excellent traditional restaurant (''Merkez Lokantasi'', Central Restaurant), cafés and other establishments scattered in the farm.

===Shopping===

[[Image:Karum Inside.HB.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An inside view of Karum Shopping &amp; Business Center.]]

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' road) near Ulus, where a myriad of things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found for bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here...like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Walking up the hill to the castle gate, you find many shops selling  a huge and fresh collection of spices, dried fruits, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in Kızılay, or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of Karum which is located to the end of the Avenue; and in the [[Atakule Tower]] in Çankaya.  Çankaya being the quarter with the highest elevation in the city, the tower has a magnificent view over the whole city, and also has a [[revolving restaurant]] at the top where the complete panorama can be enjoyed in a more leisurely fashion. 

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, there are several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities along the western highway, also known as [[Eskisehir Province|Eskisehir]] road. The Armada mall on the highway, the Galleria in Ümitköy, and a huge mall in Bilkent Center offering North American and European style mall-shopping opportunities (These can be reached following the Eskişehir highway).

'''Arabic''' ({{ar|اللغة العربية}};  ''{{ArabDIN|al-luġatu-l-ʻarabiyyatu}}'', less formally, {{ar|عربي}}  ''{{ArabDIN|ʻarabī}}'') is the largest member of the [[Semitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] (classification: South Central Semitic) and is closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. It is spoken throughout the [[Arab world]] and is widely studied and known throughout the [[Islamic world]]. Arabic has been a [[literary language]] since at least the [[6th century]] and is the [[liturgical language]] of [[Islam]].

Quite a few [[English language|English]] words are ultimately derived from Arabic, often through other [[Europe]]an languages, especially [[Spanish language|Spanish]], among them every-day vocabulary like &quot;[[sugar]]&quot; (''sukkar''),  &quot;[[cotton]]&quot; (''{{unicode|quṭūn}}'')  or &quot;[[magazine]]&quot; (''[[makhzen|{{ArabDIN|maḫāzin}}]]''). More recognizable are words like &quot;[[algebra]]&quot;, &quot;[[alcohol]]&quot; and &quot;zenith&quot; (see [[list of English words of Arabic origin]]).

==Literary and Modern Standard Arabic==
The term &quot;Arabic&quot; may refer either to [[literary Arabic]] or [[Modern Standard Arabic]] or to the many localized [[varieties of Arabic]] commonly called &quot;colloquial Arabic.&quot; Arabs consider literary Arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects. [[Literary Arabic]], ''{{ArabDIN|al-luġatu-l-ʻarabiyyatu-l-fuṣḥā}}'' (Literally: &quot;the most eloquent Arabic language&quot; &amp;mdash; {{ar|اللغة العربية الفصحى}}) refers both to the language of present-day media across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] and to the more articulate language of the [[Qur'an]]. (The expression ''media'' here includes most television and radio, and all written matter, including all books, newspapers, magazines, documents of every kind, and reading primers for small children.) &quot;Colloquial&quot; or &quot;dialectal&quot; Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from Classical Arabic, spoken daily across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], which constitute the everyday spoken language. These sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible. These dialects are not typically written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry) exists in many of them. They are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media, such as [[soap opera]]s and [[talk show]]s.
Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]–the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school-taught literary Arabic (to an equal or lesser degree). This diglossic situation facilitates [[code switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth unaware between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence.  In instances in which Arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation only to find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), both should be able to code switch into Literary Arabic for the sake of communication.  

Since the written Arabic of today differs from the written Arabic of the [[Qur'an]]ic era, it has become customary in western scholarship and among non-Arab scholars of Arabic to refer to the language of the Qur'an as [[Classical Arabic]] and the modern language of the media and of formal speech as [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Arabs, on the other hand, often use the term ''{{Unicode|fuṣḥā}}'' to refer to both forms, thus placing greater emphasis on the similarities between the two. The difference between Arabic of the Qur'anic era and today's Classical Arabic is only in the degree of eloquence. The vocabulary, the syntactic and grammatical rules are the same.

==Arabic and Islam==
It is sometimes difficult to translate [[Islam]]ic concepts, and concepts specific to [[Arab culture]], without using the original Arabic terminology. The [[Qur'an]] is expressed in Arabic and traditionally [[Muslim]]s deem it impossible to translate in a way that would adequately reflect its exact meaning&amp;mdash;indeed, until recently, some schools of thought maintained that it should not be translated at all. A [[list of Islamic terms in Arabic]] covers those terms which are too specific to translate in one phrase. While Arabic is strongly associated with [[Islam]] (and is the language of [[salah]]), it is also spoken by [[Arab Christians]], Oriental {{Unicode|([[Mizrahi Jews|Mizraḥi]])}} [[Jew]]s, and smaller sects such as Iraqi [[Mandaean]]s. Even so, a majority of the world's [[Muslims]] do not actually speak Arabic, but only know some fixed phrases of the language, such as those used in Islamic prayer. However, to counteract this trend, non-Arabic-speaking Muslims are strongly encouraged to learn the language.

==Classification and related languages==
[[Maltese language|Maltese]], which is spoken on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]], is the only surviving European language to derive primarily from Arabic, though it contains a large number of [[Italian language|Italian]] and English borrowings.

==Dialects==
''See [[varieties of Arabic]] for main article''

&quot;Colloquial Arabic&quot; is a collective term for the spoken languages or dialects of people throughout the Arab world, which, as mentioned, differ radically from the [[literary language]]. The main dialectal division is between the [[Maghreb]] dialects and those of the [[Middle East]], followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative [[Bedouin]] dialects.  [[Maltese language|Maltese]], though descended from Arabic, is considered a separate language. Speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of Arabic; in particular, while Middle Easterners can generally understand one another, they often have trouble understanding Maghrebis (although the converse is not true, due to the popularity of Middle Eastern&amp;mdash;especially Egyptian&amp;mdash;films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among [[Romance languages]], retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fiih'', and North African ''kayen'' all mean &quot;there is&quot;, and all come from Arabic (''yakuun'', ''fiihi'', ''kaa'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

The major groups are:

*[[Egyptian Arabic]]
*[[Maghreb Arabic]] ([[Algerian Arabic]], [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Tunisian Arabic]] and western Libyan)
*[[Levantine Arabic]] (Western Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and western Jordanian, [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]])
*[[Iraqi Arabic]] ([[Khuzestani Arabic]]), which has significant [[Persian language|Persian]] influence and is not understood by most other Arabic speakers
*[[Gulf Arabic]]   (Eastern Syrian, Kuwaiti, Saudi Arabian, Persian Gulf coast from Iraq to Oman including much of Saudi Arabia's [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], and minorities on the other side)

Other varieties include:

* {{unicode|[[Hassaniya|Ḥassānīya]]}} (in Mauritania and western Sahara)
* [[Andalusi Arabic]] (extinct, but important role in literary history)
* [[Maltese language|Maltese]]
* [[Sudanese Arabic]] (with a dialect continuum into Chad)
* [[Baharna Arabic]] (Bahrain, Saudi Eastern Province, and Oman)
* [[Hijazi Arabic]] (west coast of Saudi Arabia, Northern Saudi Arabia, eastern Jordan, Western Iraq)
* [[Najdi Arabic]] (Najd region of central Saudi Arabia)
* [[Yemeni Arabic]] (Yemen to southern Saudi Arabia)

See [[Arabic alphabet]] for explanations on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic symbols found in this chart.

# {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} by some speakers. This is especially characteristic of the Egyptian and southern Yemeni dialects. In many parts of North Africa and in the Levant, it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
# {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[lˁ]}} only in {{IPA|/ʔalˁːɑːh/}}, the name of God, i.e. [[Allah]], when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarised: ''bismi l-lāh'' {{IPA|/bɪsmɪlːæːh/}}).
# {{IPA|/ʕ/}} is usually a phonetic [[approximant]].
# In many varieties (if not most), {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}} are actually [[epiglottal]] {{IPA|[ʜ, ʢ]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works).

The consonants traditionally termed &quot;emphatic&quot; {{IPA|/tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ/}} are either [[velarization|velarised]] {{IPA|[tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ]}} or [[pharyngealization|pharyngealised]] {{IPA|[tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ]}}.  In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter e.g. {{IPA|/dˁ/}}  is written ‹D›; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it e.g. ‹ḍ›.

Vowels and consonants can be (phonologically) short or long.  Long (geminate) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark [[shaddah]], which marks lengthened consonants.  Such consonants are held twice as long as short consonants.  This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: e.g.  ''qabala'' &quot;he received&quot; and  ''qabbala'' &quot;he kissed&quot;.

===Syllable structure===
Arabic has two kinds of syllable: open syllables (CV) and (CVV) - and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC).  Every syllable begins with a consonant - or else a consonant is borrowed from a previous word through elision – especially in the case of the definite article THE, ''al'' (used when starting an utterance) or ''_l'' (when following a word), e.g. ''baytu –l mudiir'' “house (of) the director”, which becomes ''bay-tul-mu-diir'' when divided syllabically.  By itself, definite ''mudiir'' would be pronounced {{IPA|/al mudiːr/}}.

===Stress===
Although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic, it does bear a strong relationship to vowel length and syllable shape, and correct word stress aids intelligibility.  In general, &quot;heavy&quot; syllables attract stress (i.e. syllables of longer duration - a closed syllable or a syllable with a long vowel).  In a word with a syllable with one long vowel, the long vowel attracts the stress (e.g. ''ki-'taab'' and ''  ‘kaa-tib'').  In a word with two long vowels, the second long vowel attracts stress (e.g.''ma-kaa-'tiib''). In a word with a &quot;heavy&quot; syllable where two consonants occur together or the same consonant is doubled, the (last) heavy syllable attracts stress (e.g. ''ya-ma-’niyy'', ''ka-'tabt'', ''ka-‘tab-na'', ma-‘jal-lah,'' ‘mad-ra-sah'', ''yur-‘sil-na'').  This last rule trumps the first two: ''ja-zaa-{{unicode|ʔ}}i-‘riyy''.  Otherwise, word stress typically falls on the first syllable: '' ‘ya-man'', ''  ‘ka-ta-bat'', etc.  The Cairo ([[Egyptian Arabic]]) dialect, however, has some idiosyncrasies in that a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, so that ''mad-‘ra-sah'' carries the stress on the second-to-last syllable, as does ''qaa-‘hi-rah''.

===Dialectal variations===
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above.  For example, non-Arabic {{IPA|[v]}} is used in the Maghreb dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names.  Semitic {{IPA|[p]}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]]) distinguish between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}.  Interdental fricatives ({{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}}) are rendered as stops {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in some dialects (principally Levantine and Egyptian) and as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language.  Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[dˁ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} coallesced into a single phoneme, becoming one or the other.  Predictably, dialects without interdental fricatives use {{IPA|[dˁ]}} exclusively, while those with such fricatives use {{IPA|[ðˁ]}}.  Again, in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language, {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} is rendered as {{IPA|[zˁ]}} in dialects without interdental fricatives.  Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render Standard {{IPA|[q]}} (a voiceless uvular stop): it retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen and Morocco (and among the [[Druze]]), while it is rendered {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in Gulf Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Upper Egypt and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan) and as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in many prestige dialects, such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus.  Thus, Arabs instantly give away their geographical (and class) origin by their pronunciation of a word such as ''qamar'' &quot;moon&quot;:  {{IPA|[qamar]}}, {{IPA|[ɡamar]}} or {{IPA|[ʔamar]}}.

== Grammar ==
''See [[Arabic grammar]]''


== Writing system ==
''Main article: [[Arabic alphabet]]''

The Arabic alphabet derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] script (which variety - [[Nabataean]] or [[Syriac]] - is a matter of scholarly dispute), to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] or [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (Maghrebi) and Eastern version of the alphabet&amp;mdash;in particular, the ''fa'' and ''qaf'' had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the [[Maghreb]], and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals). However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools ([[zaouia]]s) of West Africa. Arabic, like other [[Semitic]] languages, is written from right to left.

===Calligraphy===

''See [[Arabic calligraphy]] for a fuller overview.''

After the definitive fixing of the Arabic script around [[786]], by [[Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi]], many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Qur'an and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Kufi.png|Kufic font]] --&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the [[Latin alphabet]], Arabic script is used to write down a [[ayah|verse]] of the Qur'an, a [[Hadith]], or simply a [[proverb]], in a spectacular composition. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. Two of the current masters of the genre are [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [http://arabworld.nitle.org/gallery.php?module_id=7 Khaled Al Saa’i].

===Transliteration===

''See [[Arabic transliteration]] and [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] for more information.''

There are a number of different standards of [[Arabic transliteration]]: methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the [[Latin alphabet]]. The more scientific standards allow the reader to recreate the exact word using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. However, these systems are heavily reliant on [[diacritic]]al marks such as &quot;š&quot; for the English ''sh'' sound.  At first sight, this may be difficult to recognize.  Less scientific, systems often use [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (like ''sh'' and ''kh''), which are usually more simple to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems.  In some cases, the ''sh'' or ''kh'' sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them -- that way, they can be distinguished from separate ''s'' and ''h'' sounds or ''k'' and ''h'' sounds, respectively.  (Compare ''gashouse'' to ''gash''.)

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the [[Arab world]], such as [[personal computers]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[Bulletin board system]]s, [[IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and [[mobile phone text messaging]]. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the [[Latin alphabet]] only, and some of them still do not have the [[Arabic alphabet]] as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometime known as [[IM_Arabic]].

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter &quot;ع&quot;, ''ayn''. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]].  Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants.  For instance, using capitalization, the letter &quot;د&quot;, or ''daal'', may be represented by '''d'''.  Its emphatic counterpart, &quot;ض&quot;, may be written as '''D'''.

'''''Apocalypse Now''''' is a [[1979 in film|1979]] [[United States|American]] [[film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] from a script by [[John Milius]] (rewritten by Coppola) which was inspired by [[Joseph Conrad]]'s classic [[novella]] ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. Set during the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of a taciturn American soldier who is sent to &quot;terminate with extreme prejudice&quot; the command of a rogue [[United States Army Special Forces]] [[colonel]]. The narrative of his journey and its culmination are studded with events which, while bizarre, are based on real Vietnam stories. The soldier's journey becomes increasingly nonlinear and hallucinatory. Coppola's agenda clearly involves larger themes; the film's subtext concerns a journey into the darkness of the human [[psyche]].

The film features performances by [[Martin Sheen]] as Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Marlow in Conrad's novel), [[Marlon Brando]] as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, [[Dennis Hopper]] as a fast-talking [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]-using photojournalist, and [[Robert Duvall]] in an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated turn as the borderline-[[psychosis|psychotic]] [[Lt. Colonel]] Kilgore. Several other actors who were (or later became) prominent stars had minor or supporting roles in the movie including [[Harrison Ford]], [[R. Lee Ermey]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] (who, only fourteen years old when shooting began in March 1976, was credited as 'Larry Fishburne').

The movie poster art for ''Apocalypse Now'' is one of the more famous paintings by [[Bob Peak]], who is considered an influential artist in the world of film when it comes to [[movie poster]]s.

==Background==
Filmed in the [[Philippines]] (most notably the [[Pagsanjan River]] and [[Hidden Valley Springs]]), the film went far over budget and schedule: a [[typhoon]] destroyed many of the sets, the Philippine Air Force helicopters used for shooting were constantly called back by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to be used in actual combat, the lead role was recast (Martin Sheen replaced [[Harvey Keitel]] after shooting had begun), Sheen then had a near-fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], Brando was intractable and out of shape, and Coppola himself was mentally fragile. Being similar in appearance and remarkably similar in voice, Martin Sheen's brother [[Joe Estevez]] [[Stand-in|stood in]] for the unwell Sheen in much of the film and some of the narration is by him.

After the first edit, the film was six hours long and had to be severely edited; the original released version was just over two and a half hours long. (Coppola re-released the film in [[2001]] under the title ''Apocalypse Now Redux'', restoring footage and sequences and lifting the running time to 200 minutes. Recent rumors have persisted that Coppola is considering releasing the true original cut on DVD, but there has been no fruition or conformation of this.)  For background information on the film, see [[Eleanor Coppola]]'s documentary, ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', released in [[1991]].

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

U.S. Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard is stationed in [[Saigon]]; a seasoned veteran, he is deeply troubled and apparently no longer fit for civilian life. A group of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] officers approach him with a special mission up-river into the remote [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] jungle to find Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a former member of the [[United States Army Special Forces]]. 

They state that Kurtz, once considered a model officer and future [[general]], has apparently gone [[insane]] and is commanding a legion of his own [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops deep in [[Neutral country|neutral]] Cambodia. Their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and/or recordings made by Kurtz himself. Willard is asked to undertake a mission to find Kurtz and dispose of him &quot;with extreme prejudice.&quot; 

Willard studies the intelligence files during the boat ride to the river entrance and learns that Kurtz, isolated in his compound, has assumed the role of a warlord and is worshipped by the natives and his own loyal men. Another officer, sent earlier to kill Kurtz, has apparently become one of his lieutenants.

Willard will begin his trip up the [[Mekong River]] on a PBR ([[Patrol boat, rigid|Patrol Boat, River]]), with an eclectic crew composed of by-the-book and formal [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief]] Phillips, a black Navy boat commander; [[Petty Officer Third Class|GM3]] Lance B. Johnson, a tanned all-American [[California]] surfer; [[Petty Officer Third Class|GM3]] Tyrone, AKA &quot;Clean&quot;, a black 17-year-old from [[The Bronx]]; and the [[Cajun]] Engineman, Jay &quot;Chef&quot; Hicks. 

[[Image:Apocalype Now Huey.jpg|thumbnail|The village attack scene in ''Apocalypse Now''.]]

The PBR arrives at a [[Landing Zone]] where Willard and the crew meet up with [[Lt. Colonel]] [[Bill Kilgore]], the merciless commander of the [[air cavalry|AirCav]] in the region, following a massive and hectic mopping-up operation of a conquered enemy town. Kilgore, a keen surfer, befriends Johnson. Later, he learns from one of his men that the beach down the coast which marks the opening to the river is perfect for [[surfing]], a factor which persuades him to capture it. The problem is, his troops say, it's &quot;[[Viet Cong|Charlie]]'s point&quot; and heavily fortified. Dismissing this complaint with the explanation that &quot;Charlie don't surf!&quot;, Kilgore orders his men to saddle up in the morning so that the AirCav can capture the town and the beach. Riding high above the coast in a fleet of [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]]s accompanied by [[Hughes H-6|H-6]]s, Kilgore launches an attack on the beach. The scene, famous for its use of [[Richard Wagner]]'s epic &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot;, ends with the soldiers surfing the barely claimed beach amidst skirmishes between infantry and VC.  After helicopters swoop over the village and demolish all visible signs of resistance, a giant [[napalm]] strike in the nearby jungle dramatically marks the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the battle.  &quot;I love the smell of [[napalm]] in the morning; smells like...victory,&quot; Kilgore exults to Willard.  The quote made it to #12 onto the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]], a list of top movie quotes.

[[Image:Apocalypse_Now_Smell_Like_Victory.jpg|thumbnail|&quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning...It smells like...victory.&quot;]]

The lighting and mood darken as the boat navigates upstream and Willard's silent obsession with Kurtz deepens.  Episodes on the journey include a run-in with a [[tiger]] while Willard and Chef search for [[mango]] fruits, an impromptu inspection of a Vietnamese [[sampan]] that leads to massacre, a surreal stop at the last American outpost during a Vietnamese attack against a wood bridge under construction there, and the shocking deaths of both &quot;Clean&quot; and Chief Phillips during a gunfire ambush with hidden Viet Cong soldiers and a spear thrown by a native on the shore, respectively.

Once arrived at Kurtz's compound, Willard leaves Chef behind with orders to call in an [[air strike]] on the village if he does not return. They are met by a borderline-psychotic freelance photographer (Hopper) who explains Kurtz's greatness and [[philosophy|philosophic]] skills to provoke his people into following him. Brought before Kurtz and held in captivity in a darkened temple, Willard’s constitution appears to weaken as Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, [[humanity]], and [[civilization]]. Kurtz explains his motives and philisophy in a famous and haunting monolgue: 

'' I've seen horrors... horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. 

''And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought: My God... the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment.'' '''Because it's judgment that defeats us'''.''

While bound outside in the pouring rain, Willard is approached by Kurtz, who places the severed head of Chef in his lap. Coppola makes little explicit, but we come to believe that Willard and Kurtz develop an understanding nonetheless; Kurtz wishes to die at Willard's hands, and Willard, having subsequently granted Kurtz his wish, is offered the chance to succeed him in his warlord-[[demigod]] role. Juxtaposed with a ceremonial slaughtering of a [[water buffalo]], Willard enters Kurtz's chamber during one of his message recordings, and kills him with a machete (This entire sequence is set to [[The End (The Doors song)|The End]] by [[The Doors]]). Lying bloody and dying on the ground, Kurtz whispers &quot;The horror...the horror.&quot; (This line is taken directly from Conrad's novella.) Willard walks through the now-silent crowd of natives until he comes upon Lance, who seems to have integrated himself into the society. The two of them make their way to the PBR and float away as Kurtz's final words echo in the wind as the screen fades to black. 

===''Redux''===
In 2001 Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now: Redux'', which restored 49 minutes of scenes that were cut from the original film, including stopovers at a [[French people|French]] [[rubber]] plantation wherein Mr. Clean is buried and a rain-soaked American base camp.  Nudity absent from the original was also included in the Redux, most notably at the French plantation and in an additional scene with the Playboy playmates (from the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show.)

In this version, Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard, which can still be seen briefly onboard the PBR in the original cut.

===Alternate Endings===
Coppola denied having any actual alternative endings. In the [[DVD]] commentary, he states that they simply had a massive amount of footage to edit with and thus had some choices to make. They did consider using the explosion footage made during their destruction of the Kurtz compound, but he later decided that implying that the air strike had been called in was contrary to his wish to offer some slight hope that we could overcome the horrors of [[war]].

However, there are multiple slightly varying versions of the ending credits.

One version, from the 70mm release, ends with no credits, and shows the boat pulling away. Another version, for the 35mm wide release, rolls the credits while the Kurtz compound is destroyed in what must be assumed was an air strike. Yet another version ends silently, without the explosions, and the credits roll over a black background.

==Themes==
''Apocalypse Now'' is a thematically rich film. The primary motif of the film is that of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', i.e. an odyssey into the darkness of humanity. 

Willard's constant narration gives us a glimpse into his fractured psychological state particularly in the opening scenes where he lies in his bed and stares blankly into the ceiling. He relates that he is on his second tour of duty and that he returned because he was unable to re-integrate himself into civilian life. 

:''Saigon... shit; I'm still only in Saigon... Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said &quot;yes&quot; to a divorce. When I was here, I wanted to be there; when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now... waiting for a mission... getting softer; every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.''

This chilling monologue besides suggesting how man is connected to war is also an allusion to [[post traumatic stress disorder]], a condition common to many Vietnam veterans. Willard's quest for Kurtz's compound parallels Kurtz's own descent into madness. He never tells his fellow shipmates of the PBR the true purpose of the mission and in a chilling scene, after his crew massacres people sailing on a sampan, Willard murders the surviving girl. Kurtz who was a committed family man and a highly respected colonel is driven insane after witnessing a vile incident commited by his enemies while on a peacekeeping mission. He realised that he can never win the war unless he surrenders his morality and kill without judgment. For Kurtz, this action drove him insane and so he gathered other disillusioned soldiers and started a strange, bizarre civilization in the Cambodian forest.

This is a subtle allusion to the bureaucracy that directs soldiers in the war. The bureaucrats propagandized the [[Vietnam War]] as a just cause to save the world from the evil of [[Communism]].

The general public and several Vietnam war veterans fiercely condemned the war and believed that the government lied and misled the public. 

Even Willard who is assigned the mission is cynical about his mission from the beginning :
: ''Charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500''

{{spoiler}}

The climax at Kurtz's compound is the most confusing and the most frequently debated aspect of the film. Several critics believe it to be anticlimactic after the earlier more action oriented scenes and also the fact that it differs greatly from other war films in that there's no final battle scenario. 

[[Roger Ebert]] in his original review defends the ending:

:''Coppola doesn't have an ending, if we or he expected the closing scenes to pull everything together and make sense of it. Nobody should have been surprised. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; doesn't tell any kind of a conventional story, doesn't have a thought-out message for us about Vietnam, has no answers, and thus needs no ending.The way the film ends now, with Brando's fuzzy, brooding monologues and the final violence, feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could.''

When Willard arrives, he is captured and put into containment as he is 'interrogated' by Kurtz who lectures and drones on about his philosophies. While other interpretations exist, it can be assumed that Kurtz wishes to die a soldier's death and has been waiting for his death. But his followers refuse to kill him and Colby([[Scott Glenn]]) who was sent to kill him ended up joining his 'tribe'. He wishes or rather hopes that Willard would be able to do so. Willard, at first does not want to as he too is converted by Kurtz's beliefs but after Kurtz's monologue and his statement on judgment, Willard understands Kurtz's desire and so decides to complete his mission by subverting his moral judgment and justifies it to himself

:''Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier, standing up, not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead, and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.''

The 'jungle' is seen as a metaphor to nature or more specifically man's human nature. After killing Kurtz, Willard is revered by the denizens of Kurtz's tribe but he instead leaves suggesting that perhaps he is capable of escaping the horror of war.

==Responses==
''Apocalypse Now'' premiered in [[1979]] to mixed reviews and received polarized responses from the audiences. It is said that it was as lauded as it was reviled. Many critics slammed the film, calling it overly pretentious, while others felt that it ended anticlimatically after a splendid first act.

[[Roger Ebert]], who hailed it as the best film of [[1979]] and added it to his list of Great Movies stated:
:&quot;Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam film, one of the greatest of all films, because it pushes beyond the others, into the dark places of the soul. It is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover.&quot;

Today, the film is regarded by many as a masterpiece of the [[New Hollywood]] era. It is on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list at number 28. Kilgore's quote &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; was number 12 on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]] list. ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine polled several critics to name the best film of the last 25 years and ''Apocalypse Now'' was named number 1.

The catastrophic production of the film unfortunately made it symbol of the dangers of excessive directorial control over a film. The production was said to have taken a toll on Coppola, both mentally and emotionally. To many cinephiles, ''Apocalypse Now'' is the last great film of a legendary director whose subsequent films have failed to match it in quality.

==Adaptation==
Although inspired by Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'', the film deviates extensively from it. The novel takes place in the [[Belgian Congo]] in the [[19th century]]; Kurtz and Marlow (who is named Willard in the movie) are commercial agents of a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[ivory]] company that brutally exploits its [[Africa|African]] native workers. In the novel, Marlow is sent to bring the ailing Kurtz home; in the movie, Willard is sent to kill Kurtz.

The character of Kilgore is an invention of the screenwriters. Nevertheless, Coppola has maintained many episodes (the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example) that respect the spirit of the novel and in particular its critique of the concept of civilization and progress. The fact that Coppola substituted [[Europe|European]] colonization with [[United States|American]] [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] does not change the universal message of the book.

==Influence==
As one of the most [[icon]]ic films of the [[1900s|20th century]], the film has been referenced and [[parody|parodied]] countless times.

===Film===
* The film was parodied in a short film called ''[[Porklips Now]]'', about health inspector Will Dullard, who makes a trip to inspect the meat processing shop of a man named Mertz.
* British film ''[[Nil by Mouth (film)|Nil by Mouth]]'', by ''[[Gary Oldman]]'', has a scene where the character Danny (played by ''[[Steve Sweeney]]'') dubs the scene that the photojournalist talks to Cap. Willard (when he is in the wood cage), as the film is played on a TV.
* In ''[[True Romance]]'', [[Clarence Worley]] calls ''Apocalypse Now'' &quot;the greatest Vietnam film ever made&quot;.
* ''[[Apocalypse Pooh]]'' is a nine-minute short which marries visuals from ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' cartoons with audio from ''Apocalypse Now''.  Amazingly, they fit perfectly, following the basic [[plot]] well.
* ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'' starring Sheen's son [[Charlie Sheen]] parodies the film. Martin Sheen, appearing once again as Willard, and Charlie Sheen's character ''Topper'' are depicted staring at each other while passing in opposite directions on PBRs on a river. As they meet each shouts in unison, &quot;I loved you in [[Wall Street (movie)|Wall Street]]!&quot;. 
* Another movie starring Charlie Sheen, ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'', has a gag scene after the end credits, in which Sheen quotes Kilgore's famous napalm line.
* In ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', shortly before &quot;Swoff&quot; and the guys are sent into action, they are watching ''Apocalypse Now'' in a theater inside the base, singing along and interacting with the infamous helicopter attack scene, much in the way one would at a ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' screening. Oddly enough, Walter Murch was editor/sound designer for both Apocalypse Now &amp; Jarhead.
* In ''[[Back to the Future Part II (film)|Back to the Future 2]]'', right after Marty meets up with Doc and the police take Jennifer away, you can see a sign behind them reading &quot;Surf Vietnam.&quot;

===Television===
* In an episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Elaine Benes]] visits her employer, [[J. Peterman]], in a scene that parodies Willard's eventual meeting with Kurtz.
* The same scene is also parodied in an episode of ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', with Captain Murphy as Kurtz and Marco as Willard.
* Parodied in the episode &quot;[[Kamp Krusty]]&quot; of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] assuming the role of Kurtz. [[Marge Simpson]] also tells her husband, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], in another episode, ''&quot;your character provides the comic relief, like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now&quot;''. The 'Ride of the Valkyries' helicopter sequence was humorously homaged in a &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror]]&quot; short. 
* In an episode of ''[[The Critic]]'', one of the films Jay Sherman reviews is a [[musical]] remake titled &quot;Apocalypse Wow.&quot;
* The episode &quot;Eekpocalypse Now!&quot; of the cartoon series ''[[Eek! the Cat]]'' cast Eek as Willard, Elmo the Elk as Colonel Kilgore and Sharky the Sharkdog as Colonel Kurtz.
* In the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode &quot;Restless,&quot;  contains [[Xander]]'s dream version of ''Apocalypse Now'', including [[Principal Snyder]] as Kurtz.
* [[Claymation]] cartoonist Corky Quakenbush produced &quot;''A Pack of Gifts Now''&quot;, which is part of his [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special)|Rudolph]] Trilogy (the other two being &quot;''Raging Rudolph''&quot; and &quot;''The Reinfather''.&quot;) The short is set in [[Saskatchewan]], with Rudolph in the Willard role and [[Santa Claus]] in the Kurtz role. Rudolph's mission is to &quot;terminate the Kringle (Santa) with extreme prejudice.&quot; This short would air on the Christmas edition of ''[[MadTV]]'' in 1999.
* In the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV show)|Scrubs]]'', the episode &quot;My Heavy Meddle&quot; ends with the janitors comment: &quot; The horror!&quot;, quoting Kurtz.
* In an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'', [[Warner Brothers]] sends Yakko, Wakko and Dot Warner on a mission to stop a crazed movie director (a parody of [[Jerry Lewis]]) from filming a movie the studio had cancelled. The trio find the director, who has created a kingdom for himself in which [[stunt double]]s worship him. They stop the film and smash him with a 50 ton weight. His last words are &quot;The hurting... the hurting...&quot; Throughout the episode, a singer who looks very much like [[Jim Morrison]] drones &quot;This is the ending, the ending of our story, the ending.&quot; 
* &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,&quot; an ''[[X-Files]]'' episode features a flashback scene where &quot;the Cigarette Smoking Man&quot; is tasked with the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]. The scene has many things similar or identical to the Scene where Willard is tasked with the assassination of Kurtz, most prominently both have a question that goes something like &quot;have you ever met myself this man or the general before?&quot; to which Willard and the CSM both reply &quot;Not personally&quot;.
* The cartoon ''[[Yvon of the Yukon]]'' has an episode that parodies the opening scene, as well as a helicopter pilot stating &quot;I love the smell of lip balm in the morning&quot;
* In a sketch in [[Alas Smith and Jones]], [[Mel Smith]] sits in a darkened room and expresses philosophies similar to that of Kurtz at length to a man who has been sent to find him, at the end of the sketch [[Griff Rhys Jones]] switches on the light to reveal that they are in fact sitting in a rather mundane bathroom with Smith sitting in the bath. Jones (a fairly dull [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|tax inspector]] perched on the toilet) reveals that he is merely investigating Smith for [[Child benefit]] fraud.

===Music===
* [[Iron Maiden]]'s &quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; on their album ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'' (1995) is very closely based on the film. Most lyrics are very close to being a direct quote from the movie.
* The [[Canada|Canadian]] band [[Death From Above 1979]] take their name from the 'Death From Above' motto on Kilgore's helicopter.
* The band [[Dismember]] uses the quote &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning!&quot; to start of their song &quot;Let the Napalm Rain.&quot;
* The band [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] uses the full quote, including &quot;smells like... victory&quot; in their song &quot;Napalm in the Morning&quot;.
* The band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] uses a sample of Dennis Hopper saying &quot;Alright, it's alright&quot; on their song &quot;N.W.O.&quot;
* The band [[The Clash]]'s song &quot;Charlie Don't Surf&quot; from their album [[Sandinista!]] derives its title and concept from the movie.
* The band [[Milhaven]] samples extensively from Kurtz's monologue at the end of the film in their song &quot;Drink a Pint of Blood a Day.&quot;
* [[Jedi Mind Tricks]] use a few clips on their CD release Violent By Design.
* [[2Pacalypse Now]] was rapper [[Tupac Shakur]]'s debut album, released in November 1991.
* [[The Dead Milkmen]] song &quot;Beach Party Vietnam&quot; is a parody of the surfing scene, and the Vietnam War in general.
* [[Fall Silent]] incorporates a clip of Marlow's &quot;The Horror...the horror&quot; in their song entitled &quot;The Great White Death.&quot;

===Video games===
* In the videogame ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a series of quests in the Stranglethorn Vale zone take you to the camp of a crazed Colonel Kurzen who has [[brainwash]]ed his men, in an attempt to kill the Colonel.
*In a homage to the infamous village attack scene, the computer game &quot;[[Battlefield Vietnam]]&quot; offers up &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot; as  a song to be played while inside helicopters and other vehicles.
* The Half-Life singleplayer mod 'Heart of Evil' is partly inspired by the film (the Vietnam War setting, a U.S. Army captain sent to assassinate a rogue colonel, the helicopter ride with &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot; in the background, the boat ride to the colonel's compound).
*In [[StarCraft]], one of the Firebat's quotes is &quot;I love the smell of napalm.&quot; The Firebats are flamethrower wielding infantry.

===Literature===
* The ''[[Star Wars]]'' novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', written by [[Matthew Stover]], is based on ''Apocalypse Now''.
* Before the members of the SAS patrol leave England in the book [[Bravo Two Zero]] by [[Andy McNab]], they watch ''Apocalypse Now''.

It is widely believed that ''Apocalypse Now'' did not win the Best Picture Oscar in 1979 due to the fact that another Vietnam epic, ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', had just won the previous year. It is often regarded as a far superior film to the 1979 winner of the award, ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''.

'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ([[13 August]] [[1899]]&amp;ndash;[[29 April]] [[1980]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born [[film]] [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]], closely associated with the [[suspense]] [[thriller]] genre. He began directing in the [[United Kingdom]] before working mostly in the [[United States]] from 1939 onwards, taking out dual citizenship in 1956.  He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades, from the [[silent film]] era, through the invention of [[talkie]]s, to the [[color]] era. Hitchcock remains one of the best known and most popular directors of all time, famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies.

Hitchcock's films draw heavily on both [[fear]] and [[fantasy]], and are known for their droll humour. They often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding. This often involves a ''[[transference]] of guilt'' in which the &quot;innocent&quot; character's failings are transferred to another character and magnified. Another common theme is the exploration of the compatibility of men and women; Hitchcock's films often take a [[cynicism|cynical]] view of traditional romantic relationships.

Although Hitchcock was an enormous [[superstar|star]] during his lifetime, he was not usually ranked highly by contemporaneous [[film critic]]s. ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'' was the only one of his films to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], although four others were nominated. Hitchcock never won the Academy Award for Best Director. He was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]] for lifetime achievement in 1967, but never personally received an [[Academy Award|Academy Award of Merit]].  The [[French New Wave]] critics, especially [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]], and [[François Truffaut]], were among the first to promote his films as having [[artistic merit]] beyond entertainment. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process.

Through his fame, public persona, and degree of creative control, Hitchcock transformed the role of the director, which had previously been eclipsed by that of the producer. He is seen today as the quintessential director who managed to combine art and entertainment in a way very few have ever matched. His innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and [[actor]]s.

==Biography==
&lt;!--- The following is okay, with more biographical material, some trimming of minor films, and less of a &quot;laundry-list&quot; exposition ---&gt;

===Early life===
Alfred Hitchcock was born on [[August 13]], [[1899]], in [[Leytonstone]], [[London]], the second son and youngest of the three children of William Hitchcock, a greengrocer, and his wife, Emma Jane Hitchcock (nee Whelan). His family was mostly [[Irish Catholic]]. Hitchcock was sent to Catholic boarding schools in London. He has said his childhood was very lonely and sheltered.

At an early age, after acting childishly, Hitchcock claimed that his father sent him to the local police station carrying a note.  When he presented the police officer on duty with the note, he was locked in a cell for a few moments, petrifying the young child.  This was a favorite anecdote of his, one which is often suggested to be the cause for the theme of distrust of police which runs through many of his films.

At 14, Hitchcock lost his father and left the Jesuit-run [[St Ignatius' College]] in [[Stamford Hill]], his school at the time, to study at the School for Engineering and Navigation. After graduating, he became a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and [[advertising]] designer with a cable company.

About that time, Hitchcock became intrigued by [[photography]] and started working in film in London. In 1920, he obtained a full-time job at Islington Studios under its American owners, [[Famous Players Film Company|Players]]-Lasky, and their British successors, [[Gainsborough Pictures]], designing the titles for silent movies.

===Pre-war British career===
As a major talent in a new industry with plenty of opportunity, he rose quickly.  In 1925, [[Michael Balcon]] of Gainsborough Pictures gave him a chance to direct his first film, ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'', made at the [[Universum Film AG|Ufa studios]] in Germany.  However, the commercial failure of this film, and his second, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'', threatened to derail his promising career, until he attached himself to the thriller genre. The resulting film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'', was released in [[1927 in film|1927]] and was a major commercial and critical success.  Like many of his earlier works it was influenced by [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] techniques he had witnessed first hand in Germany. In it, attractive blondes are strangled and the new lodger ([[Ivor Novello]]) in the Bunting family's upstairs apartment falls under heavy suspicion.  This is the first truly &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; film, incorporating such themes as the &quot;wrong man&quot;.

Following the success of ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock began his first  efforts to promote himself in the media, and hired a publicist to cement his growing reputation as one of the British film industry's rising stars. In 1926, he was to marry his assistant director [[Alma Reville]]. They had a daughter, Patricia, in 1928. Alma was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. She wrote some of his screenplays and worked with him on every one of his films.

In 1929, he began work on ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', his tenth film. While the film was in production, the studio decided to make it one of Britain's first sound pictures. With the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the [[British Museum]], ''Blackmail'' also began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as the backdrop to a story.

In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success, while his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), is often considered one of the best films from his early period. It was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot;, a plot device around which a whole story would revolve. In ''The 39 Steps'', the MacGuffin is a stolen set of blueprints. 

His next major success was in 1938, ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'', a clever and fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman ([[Dame May Whitty]]), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Vandrika (a thinly-veiled version of [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]).

By the end of the 1930s, Hitchcock was at the top of his game artistically, and in a position to name his own terms when [[David O. Selznick]] managed to entice the Hitchcocks across to Hollywood.

===Hollywood===
Hitchcock's ''[[gallows humour]]'' continued in his American work, together with the suspense that became his trademark. However, working arrangements with his new producer were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems and Hitchcock was often unhappy with the amount of creative control demanded by Selznick over his films. Subsequently, Selznick ended up &quot;loaning&quot; Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself.

With the prestigious picture ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'' in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, although it was set in England and based on a novel by English author Dame [[Daphne du Maurier]]. This [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] [[melodrama]] explores the fears of a naïve young bride who enters a great English country home and must grapple with a distant husband, a predatory housekeeper, and the legacy of her husband's late wife. It has also subsequently been noted for the lesbian undercurrents in [[Judith Anderson]]'s performance. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] of 1940.  Hitchcock's second American film, the European-set thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent]]'' was also nominated for Best Picture that year. 

Hitchcock's work during the 1940's was very diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy, ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) and the courtroom drama ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947), to the dark and disturbing ''Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943). 

''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', his personal favorite, was about young Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Spencer ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of murder. In its use of overlapping characters, dialogue, and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential, including [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. The film also harkens to one of Cotten's better known films, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' explored the then very fashionable subject of [[psychoanalysis]] and featured a dream sequence which was designed by [[Salvador Dali]]. The actual dream sequence in the film was considerably cut from the original planned scene that was to run for some minutes but proved too disturbing for the finished film.

''[[Notorious]]'' (1946) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. As Selznick failed to see the subject's potential, he allowed Hitchcock to make the film for [[RKO]]. From this point on, Hitchcock would produce his own films, giving him a far greater degree of freedom to pursue the projects that interested him.  Starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Hitchcock regular [[Cary Grant]], and featuring a plot about Nazis, uranium, and South America, ''[[Notorious]]'' was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films.  Its inventive use of suspense and props briefly led to Hitchcock being under surveillance by the [[CIA]] due to his use of [[uranium]] as a plot device.  

''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|Rope]]'' (his first color film) came next in 1948. Here Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]''. He also experimented with exceptionally long takes - up to ten minutes (see [[Alfred Hitchcock#Themes and devices|Themes and devices]]).  Featuring [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, ''Rope'' was the first of an eventual four films Stewart would make for Hitchcock.  Based on the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s, ''Rope'' is also among the earliest openly gay-themed films to emerge from the [[Hays Office]] controlled Hollywood studio era.

''[[Under Capricorn]]'', set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used this short-lived technique, but to a more limited extent. For these two films he formed a production company with Sidney Bernstein, called Transatlantic Pictures, which folded after these two unsuccessful pictures.

===Peak years and decline===
With ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), his first epic film based on the novel by [[Patricia Highsmith]], Hitchcock combined many of the best elements from his preceding British and American films.  Two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty. One of the men, though, takes this banter entirely seriously. With [[Farley Granger]] reprising some elements of his role from ''Rope'', ''Strangers'' continued the director's interest in the narrative possiblities of homosexual blackmail and murder. 

Three very popular films, all starring [[Grace Kelly]], followed. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' was adapted from the popular stage play by Frederick Knott. This was originally another experimental film, with Hitchcock using the technique of [[3-D film|3D]] cinematography, although the film was never released in this format. ''[[Rear Window]]'', starred James Stewart again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Here the wheelchair-bound Stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has murdered his wife. Like ''[[Lifeboat]]'' and ''[[Rope]]'', the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', set in the French Riviera, starred Kelly and [[Cary Grant]]. 

In 1956, Hitchcock also remade his 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', this time with [[James Stewart]] and [[Doris Day]]. 

1958's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' again starred Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. The film was a commercial failure, but has come to be viewed by many as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. 

Hitchcock followed ''Vertigo'' with three very different films, which were all massive commercial successes. All are also recognised as among his very best films: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). The latter two were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks, both by [[Bernard Herrmann]]: the screeching strings in the murder scene in ''Psycho'' pushed the limits of the time, and ''The Birds'' dispensed completely with conventional instruments, using an electronically produced soundtrack. These were his last great films, after which his career slowly wound down. In 1972 Hitchcock returned to [[London]] to film ''[[Frenzy]]'', his last major success. For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. 

Failing health slowed down his output over the last two decades of his life.

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was his last film. It related the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover [[Bruce Dern]] making a living from her phony powers. [[William Devane]] and [[Katherine Helmond]] co-starred.

Hitchcock was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1980 [[New Years Honours]]. He died just four months later, on [[April 29]], before he had the opportunity to be formally invested by the Queen. He was nevertheless entitled to be known as '''Sir Alfred Hitchcock''' and to use the postnominal letters [[KBE]], because he remained a British subject when he adopted American citizenship in 1956.

Alfred Hitchcock died from [[renal failure]] in his [[Bel Air]], [[Los Angeles]], home aged 80, and was survived by his wife [[Alma Reville]], and their daughter, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell. His body was cremated, and apparently there was no public funeral or memorial service.

==Themes and devices==
Hitchcock preferred the use of suspense over surprise in his films. In surprise, the director assaults the viewer with frightening things. In suspense, the director tells or shows things to the audience which the characters in the film do not know, and then artfully builds tension around what will happen when the characters finally learn the truth.

Further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent and the guilty, occasionally making this indictment clear, Hitchcock also makes voyeurs of his &quot;respectable&quot; audience. In ''Rear Window'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]), after L. B. Jeffries (played by James Stewart) has been staring across the courtyard at him for most of the film, Lars Thorwald (played by [[Raymond Burr]]) confronts Jeffries by saying &quot;What do you want of me?&quot; Burr might as well have been addressing the audience.  In fact, shortly before asking this, Thorwald turns to face the camera directly for the first time &amp;mdash; at this point, audiences often gasp.

One of Hitchcock's favourite devices for driving the plots of his stories and creating suspense was what he called the &quot;[[MacGuffin]].&quot; The plots of many of his suspense films revolve around a &quot;MacGuffin&quot;: a detail which, by inciting curiosity and desire, drives the plot and motivates the actions of characters within the story, but whose specific identity and nature is unimportant to the spectator of the film. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', for instance, &quot;Carlotta Valdes&quot; is a MacGuffin; she never appears and the details of her death are unimportant to the viewer, but the story about her ghost's haunting of Madeleine Elster is the spur for Scottie's investigation of her, and hence the film's entire plot. In ''[[Notorious]]'' the uranium that the main characters must recover before it reaches Nazi hands serves as a similarly arbitrary motivation: any dangerous object would suffice. And state secrets of various kinds serve as MacGuffins in several of the spy films, like ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]''.

Most of Hitchcock's films contain [[cameo role|cameo]] [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|appearances by Hitchcock himself]]: the director would be seen for a brief moment boarding a bus, crossing in front of a building, standing in an apartment across the courtyard, or appearing in a photograph. This playful gesture became one of Hitchcock's signatures. As a recurring theme he would carry a musical instrument &amp;mdash; especially memorable was the large double bass case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of ''[[Strangers on a Train]]''. 

In his earliest appearances he would fill in as an obscure extra, standing in a crowd or walking through a scene in a long camera shot. But he became more prominent in his later appearances, as when he turns to see [[Jane Wyman]]'s disguise when she passes him on the street in ''[[Stage Fright]]'', and in stark silhouette in his final film ''[[Family Plot]]''. In another amusing cameo, albeit just a photograph, Hitchcock's picture is seen in the &quot;before&quot;
side of a newspaper weight loss ad in ''[[Lifeboat]]''. (See a [[list of Hitchcock cameo appearances]].)  

Hitchcock includes the consumption of brandy in nearly every sound film.  &quot;I'll get you some brandy. Drink this down. Just like medicine ...&quot; says James Stewart's character to [[Kim Novak]], in ''Vertigo.''  In a real life incident,  Hitchcock dared Montgomery Clift at a dinner party around the filming of ''I Confess'' to swallow a carafe of brandy, which caused his lead actor to pass out, almost immediately. This near obsession with brandy remains unexplained.

Another almost inexplicable feature of any Hitchcock film is the inclusion of a staircase. Of course, stairways inspire many suspenseful moments, most notably [[Farley Granger]]'s character visit to the murderer in ''[[Strangers On A Train]]'' or the detective's demise in the Bates' mansion in ''Psycho.'' However, a completely nonfunctional staircase adorns the apartment of the James Stewart character in ''[[Rear Window]]'', as if Hitchcock feels compelled to its inclusion by some unspoken superstition.

Hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of filmmaking. In ''Lifeboat'', Hitchcock sets the entire action of the movie in a small boat, yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition. His trademark cameo appearance was a dilemma, given the claustrophobic setting; so Hitchcock appeared on camera in a fictitious newspaper ad for a weight loss product.  

In ''Spellbound'' two unprecedented point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and outsized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-colored red on some copies of the black-and-white print of the film.

''Rope'' (1948) was another technical challenge: a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single take. The film was actually shot in eight takes of approximately 10 minutes each, which was the amount of film that would fit in a single camera reel; the transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

His 1958 film ''Vertigo'' contains a camera trick that has been imitated and re-used so many times by filmmakers, it has become known as the [[Hitchcock zoom]].

Although famous for inventive camera angles, Hitchcock generally avoided points of view that were physically impossible from a human perspective. For example, he would never place the camera looking out from inside a refrigerator.

Regarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumor that he had said that actors were cattle.  Hitchcock later denied this, typically [[tongue-in-cheek]], clarifying that he had only said that actors should be treated like cattle.  [[Carole Lombard]], tweaking Hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity, brought some cows along with her when she reported to the set of ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''.

Hitchcock often dealt with matters that he felt were sexually preverse or kinky, and many of his films darring subverted the restrictive Hollywood Production Code that prohibited any mention of [[homosexuality]].

==His character and its effects on his films==
Hitchcock's films sometimes feature male characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]'s character) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him (in this case, they are).  In ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), the [[Rod Taylor]] character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolizes his mother. The villain Bruno in ''[[Strangers on a Train]]'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Norman Bates' troubles with his mother in ''[[Psycho]]'' are infamous. 

Hitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem at first to be proper but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, perhaps criminal way. As noted, the famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)| The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs. In ''[[Marnie]]'' (1964), glamorous blonde [[Tippi Hedren]] is a [[kleptomania]]c. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), glamorous blonde [[Grace Kelly]] offers to help someone she believes is a cat burglar. After becoming interested in Thorwald's life in ''Rear Window'', Lisa breaks into Thorwald's apartment. And, most notoriously, in ''Psycho'', [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 and gets murdered by a young man named [[Norman Bates]] (played by [[Anthony Perkins]]) who thought he was his own mother. His last blonde heroine was French actress [[Claude Jade]] as the secret agent's worried daughter, Michele, in '''Topaz''' (1969).

Hitchcock saw that reliance on actors and actresses was a holdover from the theater tradition.  He was a pioneer in using camera movement, camera set ups and montage to explore the outer reaches of cinematic art.

Most critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' is probably the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.

Hitchcock often said that his personal favourite was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.

==His style of working==
Hitchcock once commented, &quot;The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest.&quot; Hitchcock was often critical of his actors and actresses as well, dismissing, for example, Kim Novak's performance in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', and once famously remarking that actors were to be treated like cattle. (In response to being accused of saying 'actors are cattle', he said 'I never said they were cattle; I said they were to be ''treated'' like cattle'.) 

The first book devoted to the director is simply named ''Hitchcock''. It is a document of a one-week interview by [[François Truffaut]] in 1967. (ISBN 0671604295)

==Awards==
The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Hitchcock the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], in 1967.  However, despite six earlier nominations, he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in a contested category. His unsuccessful Oscar nominations were:

* for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]:  ''Rebecca'' (1940), ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Rear Window]]'', and ''[[Psycho]]''; and
* as a producer, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Suspicion]]'' (1941).  

However ''Rebecca'', which Hitchcock did direct, won the 1940 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar for its producer [[David O. Selznick]].  Three other films Hitchcock directed were unsuccessfully nominated for Best Picture.

Hitchcock was knighted in 1980.



==Other notes==
From [[1955 in television|1955]] to [[1965 in television|1965]], Hitchcock was the host and producer of a long-running [[television]] series entitled ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His [[irony]]-tinged voice, image, and mannerisms became instantly recognizable and were often the subject of parody. He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture ''[[Psycho]]''. In the late 1980s, a new version of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions.

Alfred Hitchcock is also immortalised in print and appeared as himself in the very popular juvenile detective series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators''. The long-running detective series was clever and well written, with characters much younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In ghost-written introductions, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; formerly introduced each case at the beginning of the book, often giving them new cases to solve. At the end of each book, Alfred Hitchcock would discuss the specifics of the case with Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw and every so often the three boys would give Alfred Hitchcock mementos of their case. 

When Alfred Hitchcock passed away, his chores as the boys' mentor/friend would be done by a fictional character: a retired detective named Hector Sebastian.  Due to the popularity of the series, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators'' scored several reprints and out of respect, the latter reprints were changed to just ''[[The Three Investigators]]''. Over the years, more than one name has been used to replace Alfred Hitchcock's character, especially for the earlier books when his role was emphasised.  

At the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hithcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.''  Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.

Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection include [[Shirley Jackson]] (''Strangers in Town'', ''[[The Lottery]]''), [[T.H. White]] (''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''), [[Robert Bloch]], [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]] and the creator of ''[[The Three Investigators]]'', [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]].

'''Anacondas''' (Jibóia and Sucuri, local names) are three species of aquatic [[boa]] inhabiting the swamps and rivers of the dense forests of tropical [[South America]] as well as the southern swamps of the island of [[Trinidad]] .

There are two possible origins for the word 'anaconda': It is perhaps an alteration of the [[Sinhalese]] word 'henakanday', meaning 'whip snake', or more likely, the [[Tamil]] word 'anaikolra', which means 'elephant killer', as early [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers in South America referred to the anaconda as 'matatoro', or 'bull killer'. It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake's native habitat, it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large [[Asia]]n [[python]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[http://news2.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/photogalleries/0802_snakes1.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

Two species are well-known:

* The '''Green Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes murinus]]''), which has been reported at over 10 meters (32.8 feet) in length (although most are considerably smaller). Although shorter than the longest recorded species, the [[Reticulated python|Reticulated Python]], it is considerably heavier. In fact, it is the heaviest [[snake]] species in existence. It can weigh 250 kg (551 pounds) and have a girth of more than 30 cm (11.8 inches) in diameter. Females are larger than males, averaging 22-26 feet and 12-16 feet respectively.  These are found mainly in northern [[South America]], in [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], northern [[Bolivia]], northeast [[Peru]], [[Guyana]], and [[Trinidad]]. Although charismatic, very little information was known about the anacondas until [[1992]] when the first study (and so far the only) was made on the field biology of this species in the Venezuelan [[llanos]] by Dr. Jesus Rivas. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.anacondas.org]&lt;/sup&gt;  

* The '''Yellow Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes notaeus]]''), which reaches a relatively smaller average adult length of 3 metres (9.8 feet). These live further south in Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], western Brazil, and northeast [[Argentina]].

The third lesser known species is:

* The '''Dark-Spotted''' or '''Deschauense's Anaconda''' (''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'') found in northeast Brazil.

''Eunectes murinus'' (formerly called ''Boa murina'') differs from [[Boa]] by the snout being covered with shields instead of small scales, the inner of the three nasal shields being in contact with that of the other side. The general colour is dark olive-[[brown]], with large oval [[black]] spots arranged in two alternating rows along the back, and with smaller white-eyed spots along the sides. The belly is whitish, spotted with black spots. The anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life, and feeds chiefly upon [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[caiman]], mostly during the night. It lies submerged in the water, with only a small part of its head above the surface, waiting for any suitable prey, or it establishes itself upon the branches of a tree which overhangs the water or the track of game.

Like almost all boas, anacondas give birth to live young.

== Giant Anacondas ==

The largest known anacondas measure about 10.6 meters (30.7 feet) long, but unverified reports of much larger snakes have occasionally been made.

One notable account was reported by adventurer [[Percy Fawcett]]. In [[1906]], Fawcett wrote that he had shot and wounded an anaconda in South America; he reported the snake measured some 18.9 meters (62 feet) from nose to tail. 

Once publicized, Fawcett’s account of the giant snake was widely ridiculed, although he insisted his account was both truthful and accurate. [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] came to his defense arguing that Fawcett was generally honest and reliable when relating things. Furthermore, Heuvelmans noted that mainstream experts were repeatedly forced to revise their limits regarding the maximum size of snakes when confronted with specimens that defied the generally-accepted estimates. At one point in time, 6 meters (20 feet) in length was the widely-accepted maximum size of an anaconda.  These giant snakes are very capable of killing and consuming an adult human being. 

When it sheds, an adult anaconda relieves itself of an average of 2 pounds of skin. An anaconda's skin can stretch up to 30% larger than the original size of the snake.

== In captivity ==

Anacondas have a reputation for bad temperament; that plus the massive size of the green species mean that anacondas are comparatively less popular as pets than other boas, but they are fairly commonly available in the exotic pet trade, with the exception of ''E. deschauenseei''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the Christian holiday. For other meanings see [[All Saints (disambiguation)]] and [[All Hallows (disambiguation)]]''
[[Image:Wszystkich swietych cmentarz.jpg|thumb|right|300px|All Saints in Poland]]
The [[festival]] of '''All Saints''', also sometimes known as &quot;All Hallows,&quot; or &quot;Hallowmas,&quot; is a feast celebrated in their honour.  '''All Saints''' is also a Christian formula invoking all the faithful [[saint]]s and [[martyr]]s, known or unknown.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] holiday (''Festum omnium sanctorum'') falls on [[November 1]], followed by [[All Souls Day]] on [[November 2]], and is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], with a [[vigil]] and an [[Octave (disambiguation)|octave]]. The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church's '''All Saints''' is the first Sunday after [[Pentecost]] and as such marks the close of the [[Easter]] season.

Common commemorations by several churches of the deaths of martyrs began to be celebrated in the 4th century.  The first trace of a general celebration is attested in [[Antioch]] on the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]. This custom is also referred to in the 74th homily of [[John Chrysostom]] ([[407]]) and is maintained to the present day in the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Church.  

The date of festival was changed to November 1 by [[Pope Gregory III]] ([[731]]&amp;ndash;[[741]]) to coincide with the ancient [[Celts |Celtic]] New Year's festival [[Samhain]]. He designated November 1 as the date of the anniversary of the consecration of a chapel in St. Peter's for the relics &quot;of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world&quot;.  By the time of the reign of [[Charlemagne]], the November festival of All Saints was widely celebrated. November 1 was decreed a day of obligation by the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Louis the Pious]] in [[835]] issued &quot;at the instance of [[Pope Gregory IV]] and with the assent of all the bishops.&quot; 

In [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]], ''ofrendas'' (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play [[Don Juan Tenorio]] is traditionally performed.  In [[Portugal]] and [[France]], people offer flowers to dead relatives. In [[Poland]] and [[Germany]], the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives.  In the [[Philippines]], the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere.  In English speaking  countries, the festival is celebrated with the hymn &quot;For All the Saints&quot;, set to music by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].

The festival was retained after the [[Reformation]] in the calendar of the [[Church of England]] and in many [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the [[Church of Sweden]], it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead (similar to the ''All Souls'' commemoration in the Eastern Orthodox Church that takes place two Saturdays before the beginning of [[Lent]]). In the [[Holidays in Sweden|Swedish calendar]], the observance takes place on the first Saturday of November.  In many Lutheran Churches however, the festival has fallen into disuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Altaic''' is a proposed [[Language families and languages|language family]] which includes 60 [[language]]s spoken by about 250 million people, mostly in and around [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]]. The relationships among these languages remain a matter of debate among historical linguists. Some scholars consider the obvious similarity between these languages as genetically inherited; others propose the idea of the [[Sprachbund]].

Its proponents traditionally considered it to include [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Turkic languages]], the [[Mongolic languages]], the [[Tungusic languages]] (or Manchu-Tungus), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Ainu language|Ainu]] has occasionally been suggested as a member of Altaic, but that hypothesis is generally rejected.  Castrén (1862) put forward a similar view, but classified Turkic with what we would now call [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]. In 1857 [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding Korean and Japanese; for Korean, G. J. Ramstedt and E. D. Polivanov put forward more etymologies in the 1920's. Korean has commonly been linked to [[Japonic_languages|Japonic]], and in [[1971]], [[Roy Miller]] suggested relating it to both Korean and Altaic.  These suggestions have been taken up and developed by various historical linguists such as [[John Whitman]], [[Sergei Starostin]], and [[Alexander Vovin]] (who now rejects a genetic connection between Korean and Japanese).

There have been  some attempts to extend the Altaic family borders by including Ainu (e.g., Street 1962, Patrie 1982), [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]], or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], but these proposals have been rejected by the majority of scholars.

==Controversy==

There are two main schools of thought about the Altaic theory. One is that the proposed constituent language families (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic in the basic theory, with the addition of Korean and Japanese in extended versions) are genetically or &quot;divergently&quot; related by descent from a common ancestor, &quot;Proto-Altaic.&quot; The other school rejects this theory (so it is often called the &quot;Anti-Altaic&quot; school) and argues that the member languages are related by convergence (mainly loan influence).

The Altaic theory is claimed by its opponents to be based mainly on typological similarities, such as [[vowel harmony]], lack of [[grammatical gender]], an [[agglutinative]] typology, and [[loanword]]s.  In fact, its proponents have put together a large variety of grammatical, lexical, and syntactic regular correspondences between the sub-groups of Altaic (e.g., Ramstedt, [[Nicholas Poppe|Poppe]], Martin, Starostin).  However, its opponents explain these as [[loanword]]s, mutual influence, or [[convergence]], arguing that, although the Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic families do have similarities, they are the result of intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers. 

The Altaic theory is highly controversial. While some support it, others (e.g., Doerfer 1963) do not regard Altaic as a valid group and see it as three (or more) separate language families. Other linguists, such as [[Bernard Comrie]] (1992, 2003), argue that Altaic may be part of a larger grouping, such as [[Nostratic]] or [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].  In contrast, [[J. Marshall Unger]] (1990) believes that languages such as Korean and Japanese may be part of a &quot;macro-Tungusic&quot; family. Vovin rejected the claim for a Koreo-Japonic branch of Altaic on the basis that they have no [[comparative_method|shared innovation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Austrian German''' is any variety of the [[German language]] spoken in [[Austria]]. There is no unitary Austrian [[language]], but a variety of [[High Germanic languages|High German]] [[dialect]]s are spoken. Besides the Germanic languages discussed here, [[minority language]]s such as [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are spoken in parts of the country.

==Overview== 
* [[Standard German]], called ''&quot;High German&quot;'' (German: ''standardsprache'' (by philologists), generally (incorrectly) referred to as ''Hochdeutsch'') in Austria.
* [[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialect similar to [[Swiss German]].
* All other dialects belong to the [[Austro-Bavarian]] group, which is a common language throughout much of the country.

==Subgroups==
Ordinarily, the latter dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria (state)|Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]]. The dialect spoken in Vorarlberg is more closely related to [[Swiss German]] than it is to other Austrian dialects, so Austrians from outside Vorarlberg normally cannot understand it.

==Intercomprehensiblity and regional accents==
While strong forms of the various dialects are not normally comprehensible to Northern [[Germany|Germans]], there is virtually no communication barrier to speakers from [[Bavaria]]. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria (state)|Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria (state)|Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and it is very easy for an Austrian after a few spoken words to judge which  Austrian dialect someone speaks. However, if it goes into the dialects of the deeper valleys of [[Tyrol]], sometimes even other Tyroleans are helpless to understand the dialect. Speakers from the different [[States of Austria|states]] of Austria can usually easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), with those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. 

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border to [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language as such.

==Standard German in Austria==
With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[administration|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late [[19th century]] and its manifold particular traditions.

Austrians speaking Standard German can almost always be recognised by their accent, much more so than speakers from most regions of [[Germany]].

When Austria became a member of the European Union, the Austrian variety of the German language (limited to 23 agricultural terms) was “protected” in the so-called Protocol no. 10 regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty. Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognised under international law / EU primary law. All facts concerning “Protocol no. 10” are documented in Markhardt, Heidemarie: Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU, Peter Lang, 2005.
==Influence of popular culture==
Dialects are receding in Austria as they are in some other areas of [[Europe]], but it can safely be said that they are more persistent than in most of Germany. Dialects are frequently used in TV series or movies in situation where it is appropriate for the particular character and situation. A classic example of a strong form of Viennese working-class dialect, for example, would be ''[[Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter]]''. However, strong varieties of dialect are not used quite as much as, for example, in Switzerland. For example, educated people in Vienna usually speak a very slight form of dialect or simply Standard German, but with the characteristic Viennese accent and, where it exists, particular Austrian and Viennese vocabulary.

A good reference for the Austrian, Bavarian and other German dialects are the dialect (&quot;Mundart&quot;) editions of [[Asterix]] and [[Obelix]] comic books which are available in [[Viennese language|Viennese]] (three editions with different dialects from inside [[Vienna]]) and at least one for the common Tyrolean dialect and one for a deep Styrian dialect.

      <comment>/* Results requiring ¬AC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of choice''', or '''AC''', is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]]. It was formulated in [[1904]] by [[Ernst Zermelo]].  While it was originally controversial, it is now used without embarrassment by most mathematicians.  However, there are still schools of mathematical thought, primarily within set theory, that either reject the axiom of choice, or even investigate consequences of axioms inconsistent with AC.

Intuitively speaking, AC says that given a collection of bins, each containing at least one object, then exactly one object from each bin can be picked and gathered in another bin - even if there are [[infinite]]ly many bins, and there is no &quot;rule&quot; for which object to pick from each.

== Statement ==

The axiom of choice states:
:Let ''X'' be a [[set]] of [[non-empty]] sets. Then we can [[choice function|choose]] a member from each set in ''X''.
Stated more formally:
:Let ''X'' be a set of non-empty sets. Then there exists a [[choice function]] ''f'' defined on ''X''. In other words, there exists a function ''f'' defined on ''X'', such that for each set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''.
Another formulation of the axiom of choice states:
:Given any set of mutually disjoint non-empty sets, there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the non-empty sets.

== Usage ==

Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly. For example, after having established that the set ''X'' contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let ''F(s)'' be one of the members of ''s'' for all ''s'' in ''X''.&quot;  In general, it is impossible to prove that ''F'' exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.

Not every situation requires the axiom of choice.  For finite sets ''X'', the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory.  In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box.  Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on.  There are only finitely many boxes, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end.  The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on.  (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of [[mathematical induction]].)

For certain infinite sets ''X'', it is also possible to avoid the axiom of choice.  For example, suppose that the elements of ''X'' are sets of natural numbers.  Every nonempty set of natural numbers has a least element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it takes each set to the least element of that set.  This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set and we can write down an explicit expression that tells us what value our choice function takes.  Any time it is possible to specify such an explicit choice, the axiom of choice is unnecessary.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set.  If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our set exists?  For example, suppose that ''X'' is the set of all non-empty subsets of the [[real number]]s.  First we might try to proceed as if ''X'' were finite.  If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because ''X'' is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we will never be able to produce a choice function for all of ''X''.  So that won't work.  Next we might try the trick of specifying the least element from each set.  But some subsets of the real numbers don't have least elements.  For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: If ''x'' is in (0,1), then so is ''x''/2, and ''x''/2 is always strictly smaller than ''x''.  So taking least elements doesn't work, either.

The reason that we are able to choose least elements from subsets of the natural numbers is the fact that the natural numbers are [[well-order]]ed: Every subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element.  Perhaps if we were clever we might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering.  Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot;  The problem then becomes constructing such an ordering, and it turns out that every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice is true.

A proof requiring the axiom of choice is always [[nonconstructive proof|nonconstructive]]: even if the proof produces an object then it is impossible to say exactly what that object is.  Consequently, while the axiom of choice asserts that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, it does not give us an example of one.  Yet the reason why we chose above to well-order the real numbers was so that for each set in ''X'', we could explicitly choose an element of that set.  If we cannot write down the well-ordering we are using, then our choice is not very explicit.  This is one of the reasons why some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice.  For example, [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] posit that all existence proofs should be totally explicit; it should be possible to construct anything that exists.  They reject the axiom of choice because it asserts the existence of an object without telling what it is.

== Independence of AC ==

By work of [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Paul Cohen]], the axiom of choice is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF).  This means that neither it nor its negation can be proven to be true in ZF.  Consequently, assuming the axiom of choice, or its negation, will never lead to a contradiction that could not be obtained without that assumption.

So the decision whether or not it is appropriate to make use of the axiom of choice in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory.  The decision must be made on other grounds.

One argument given in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient to use it: using it cannot hurt (cannot result in contradiction) and makes it possible to prove some propositions that otherwise could not be proved.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement which is independent of ZF.  For example, the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZF plus the axiom of choice (ZFC).  However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

One reason that some mathematicians dislike the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of some bizarre counter-intuitive objects.  An example of this is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which says in effect that it is possible to &quot;carve up&quot; the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotation and translation, reassemble the pieces into two balls each with the same volume as the original.  Note that the proof, like all proofs involving the axiom of choice, is an existence proof only: it does not tell us how to carve up the unit sphere to make this happen, it simply tells us that it can be done.

On the other hand, the [[negation]] of the axiom of choice is also bizarre.  For example, the statement that for any two sets ''S'' and ''T'', the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''T'' or the cardinality of ''T'' is less than or equal to the cardinality of ''S'' is equivalent to the axiom of choice.  Put differently, if the axiom of choice is false, then there are sets ''S'' and ''T'' of incomparable size: neither can be mapped in a one-to-one fashion onto a subset of the other.

A third possibility is to prove theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation, a tactic preferred in constructive mathematics.  Such statements will be true in any [[model theory|model]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model.  This renders any claim that relies on either the axiom of choice or its negation undecidable.  For example, under such an assumption, the Banach–Tarski paradox is neither true nor false: It is impossible to construct a decomposition of the unit ball which can be reassembled into two unit balls, and it is also impossible to prove that it can't be done.  However, the Banach–Tarski paradox can be rephrased as a statement about models of ZF by saying, &quot;In any model of ZF in which AC is true, the Banach–Tarski paradox is true.&quot;  Similarly, all the statements listed below under [[#Results requiring AC|Results requiring AC]] are undecidable in ZF, but since each is provable in any model of ZFC, there are models of ZF in which each statement is true.

== Weaker forms of AC ==

There are several weaker statements which are not equivalent to the axiom of choice, but which are closely related.  A simple one is the [[axiom of countable choice]], which states that a choice function exists for any countable set ''X''.  This usually suffices when trying to make statements about the real numbers, for example, because the rational numbers, which are countable, form a dense subset of the reals.  See also the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], the [[ultrafilter lemma]], the [[axiom of dependent choice]], and the [[Uniformization (set theory)|axiom of uniformization]].

== Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) ==

One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that it shows up. There are also a remarkable number of important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice.  The most important among them are [[Zorn's lemma]] and the [[well-ordering theorem]]: every set can be well-ordered.  In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering principle.  Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC).  Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

* [[Set theory]]
** Any [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] countable sets is itself countable.
** If the set ''A'' is [[infinite]], then there exists an [[injective function|injection]] from the [[natural number]]s '''N''' to ''A''.
** If the set ''A'' is infinite, then ''A'' and ''A''×''A'' have the same [[cardinality]]. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** [[Trichotomy]]: If two sets are given, then they either have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** The product of any nonempty family of nonempty sets is nonempty. ''(This statement is equivalent to AC (over ZF))''
** Every infinite [[determinacy#Basic notions|game]] &lt;math&gt;G(T,X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is either [[open set|open]] or [[closed set|closed]] is [[determinacy#Basic notions|determined]].

* [[Measure theory]]
** The [[Vitali set|Vitali theorem]] on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s.
** The [[Hausdorff paradox]].
** The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].

== Results requiring ¬AC ==

There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false.  We will abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬C.  For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to prove the negation of some standard facts.
Note that any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, so for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a function ''f'' from the real numbers to the real numbers such that ''f'' is not continuous at ''a'', but for any sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} converging to ''a'', lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; f(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=f(a).
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which real numbers are a countable union of countable sets.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a field with no algebraic closure.
*In all models of ZF¬C there is a vector space with no basis.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which there is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.

For proofs, see Thomas Jech, ''The Axiom of Choice'', American Elsevier Pub. Co., New York, 1973.

*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which every set in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[measurable]].  Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] which are provable in ZFC.  Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the [[Axiom of dependent choice]], which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of [[real analysis]].
*In all models of ZF¬C, the [[Continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

== Results requiring choice in intuitionistic logic, though not classically ==
Interestingly, in various varieties of [[constructive logic]] (in particular, [[intuitionistic logic]]) in which the [[law of excluded middle]] is not assumed, the assumption of the axiom of choice is sufficient to obtain the law of excluded middle as a theorem. To see this, for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;U\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 0) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; be the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 1) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Set-builder notation]]). By the axiom of choice, there will exist a choice function &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; for the set &lt;math&gt;\{U, V\}\,&lt;/math&gt; (note that, although the axiom of choice isn't classically required in order to obtain choice functions for finite sets, it is necessary here in intuitionistic logic). Since &lt;math&gt;f(U) \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(V) \in V&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;[(f(U) = 0) \vee P] \wedge [(f(V) = 1) \vee P]&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;U = V = \{0, 1\}\,&lt;/math&gt;, it must be that &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) = f(V)\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P&lt;/math&gt; would imply &lt;math&gt;\neg P \vee P&lt;/math&gt;. As this could be done for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt;, this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle.

The above proof is not valid in all intuitionistic deductive systems.  For example, in the [[intuitionistic type theory]] of [[Per Martin-Löf]], the axiom of choice is a theorem, yet excluded middle is not.

[[Image:Checa-HunCharge.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Huns]], led by Attila (right, foreground), ride into [[Italy]].]]

'''Attila the Hun''' ([[Old Norse]]: ''Atle, Atli''; [[Middle High German]]: ''Etzel''; ca. [[406]]&amp;ndash;[[453]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]) was the last and most powerful king of the [[Huns]]. &lt;!--He was from [[Bulgars]] [[clan]] of [[Dulo]]. This information looks bogus. References please--&gt; He reigned over what was then [[Europe]]'s largest [[empire]], from [[434]] until his death. His empire stretched from [[Central Europe]] to the [[Black Sea]] and from the [[Danube|Danube River]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. During his rule he was among the direst enemies of the Eastern and Western [[Roman Empire]]s: he invaded the [[Balkans]] twice and encircled [[Constantinople]] in the second invasion. He marched through [[Gaul]] (later [[France]]) as far as [[Orleans]] before being turned back at [[Battle of Chalons|Chalons]]; and he drove the western emperor [[Valentinian III]] from his [[capital]] at [[Ravenna]] in [[452]].

Though his empire died with him and he left no remarkable [[legacy]], he has become a legendary figure in the [[history of Europe]]. In much of [[Western Europe]], he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. In contrast, some histories lionize him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three [[Norse saga]]s.

==Background and beginnings==
:''Main article: [[Huns]]''

The European [[Huns]] are often thought to have been a western extension of the [[Xiongnu]] (''Xiōngnú''), (匈奴) n., a group of [[nomad]] tribes from north-eastern [[China]] and [[Central Asia]]. These people achieved military superiority over their rivals (most of them highly cultured and civilized) by their state of readiness for combat, amazing mobility, and weapons like the [[Hun bow]].

Attila was born around 406. Nothing certain is known about his childhood; the supposition that at a young age he was already a capable leader and a capable warrior is reasonable but unknowable.

Following [[negotiation]] of peace terms in [[418]], the young Attila, at the age of 12, was sent as a child [[hostage]] to the Roman [[Royal court|court]] of Emperor [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]]. In return, the Huns received [[Flavius Aetius]], in a child hostage exchange arranged by the Romans.

Most likely the empire schooled Attila in its courts, customs and traditions and in its luxurious [[lifestyle]], in the hope that he would carry an appreciation of these things back to his own nation, thus serving to extend Roman influence. The Huns would probably have hoped that Attila would enhance [[espionage]] capabilities by the exchange. 

Attila attempted escape during his stay in Rome but failed. He turned his attention to an intense study of the empire while outwardly ceasing to struggle against his hostage status. He studied the internal and [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] of the Romans. He often secretly observed them in [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] conference with [[foreign minister]]s. He learned about [[leadership]], [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] and other essentials suited to future rulers and diplomats.

==Shared kingship==
[[Image:Huns empire.png|thumb|300px|left|The Hunnish empire stretched from the [[steppe]]s of Central Asia into modern [[Germany]], and from the Danube river to the Baltic Sea]]

By [[432]], the Huns were united under [[Ruga]]. In [[434]] Ruga died, leaving his [[nephew]]s Attila and [[Bleda]], the sons of his brother [[Mundjuk]], in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were [[bargain]]ing with [[Theodosius II]]'s envoys over the return of several [[renegade]] tribes who had taken refuge within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day [[Pozarevac|Požarevac]])  and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful [[treaty]]: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the [[Vandals]]), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and departed into the interior of the [[continent]], perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the [[walls of Constantinople]], building the city's first [[sea wall]], and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next five years. During this time, they were conducting an [[invasion]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. However, in [[Armenia]], a Persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for Attila and Bleda, and they ceased their efforts to conquer Persia. In [[440]], they reappeared on the borders of the empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been arranged for by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the [[bishop]] of Margus (not far from modern [[Belgrade]]) had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste to [[Illyria]]n cities and forts on the river, among them, according to [[Priscus]], [[Viminacium]], which was a city of the [[Moesian]]s in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the barbarians and betrayed the city to them.

Theodosius had stripped the river's defenses in response to the Vandal [[Geiseric]]'s capture of [[Carthage]] in [[440]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] [[Yazdegerd II of Persia|Yazdegerd II]]'s invasion of [[Armenia]] in [[441]]. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Sigindunum (modern [[Belgrade]]) and [[Sirmium]] before halting its operations. A lull followed during [[442]], when Theodosius recalled his troops from [[North Africa]] and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings' demands.

Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their [[Military campaign|campaign]] in [[443]]. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of [[Ratiara]] and successfully besieged Naissus (modern [[Niš]]) with [[battering ram]]s and rolling towers&amp;mdash;military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory&amp;mdash;then pushing along the [[Nisava]] they took Serdica ([[Sofia]]), Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]), and [[Arcadiopolis]]. They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of [[siege|siege equipment]] capable of breaching the city's massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official [[Anatolius]] to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (ca. 1,963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 ''solidi''.

Their desires contented for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to [[Jordanes]] (following [[Priscus]]), sometime during the peace following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around [[445]]), Bleda died (killed by his brother, according to the classical sources), and Attila took the throne for himself. Now undisputed lord of the Huns, he again turned towards the eastern Empire.

==Sole ruler==
Constantinople suffered major [[natural disaster|natural]] (and man-made) disasters in the years following the Huns' departure: bloody [[riot]]s between the [[Chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|racing factions]] of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]; [[Pandemic|plague]]s in [[445]] and [[446]], the second following a [[famine]]; and a four-month series of [[earthquake]]s which levelled much of the [[defensive wall|city wall]] and killed thousands, causing another [[epidemic]]. This last struck in [[447]], just as Attila, having consolidated his power, again rode south into the empire through [[Moesia]]. The [[Roman military history|Roman army]], under the [[Goths|Gothic]] ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Arnegisclus]], met him on the river [[Vid]] and was defeated&amp;mdash;though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as [[Thermopylae]]; Constantinople itself was saved by the intervention of the prefect [[Flavius Constantinus]], who organized the citizenry to reconstruct the earthquake-damaged walls, and in some places to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. An account of this invasion survives:

: ''The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in [[Thrace]], became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. … And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the [[churches]] and [[monasteries]] and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.''
::&amp;mdash; Callinicus, in his ''Life of Saint Hypatius''
[[Image:MorThanFeastofAttila.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Mór Than]]'s painting ''The Feast of Attila'', based on a fragment of [[Priscus]] (depicted at right, dressed in white and holding his history):&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;&quot;When evening began to draw in, torches were lighted, and two barbarians came forward in front of Attila and sang songs which they had composed, hymning his victories and his great deeds in war. And the banqueters gazed at them, and some were rejoiced at the songs, others became excited at heart when they remembered the wars, but others broke into tears&amp;mdash;those whose bodies were weakened by time and whose spirit was compelled to be at rest.&quot; &lt;/small&gt;]]

Attila demanded, as a condition of peace, that the Romans should continue paying [[tribute]] in gold&amp;mdash;and evacuate a strip of land stretching three hundred miles east from Sigindunum ([[Belgrade]]) and up to a hundred miles south of the Danube. Negotiations continued between Roman and Hun for approximately three years. The [[historian]] [[Priscus]] was sent as emissary to Attila's encampment in [[448]], and the fragments of his reports preserved by Jordanes offer the best glimpse of Attila among his numerous wives, his [[Scythia]]n fool, and his [[Moors|Moor]]ish [[dwarf]], impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers:

:''A luxurious meal, served on [[silver]] plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood, while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too, was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.''

&quot;The floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on,&quot; Priscus noted.

During these three years, according to a legend recounted by Jordanes, Attila discovered the  &quot;Sword of Mars&quot;:
:''The historian Priscus says it was discovered under the following circumstances: &quot;When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him.''
::&amp;mdash; Jordanes, ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'' ch. XXXV [http://www.boudicca.de/jordanes3-e.htm (e-text)]

Later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the [[Central Asia]]n steppes.

==Attila in the west==
[[Image:AttilaTheHun.jpg|frame|An inaccurate sketch of Attila the Hun, probably from the [[19th century]]&lt;!-- my guess --mirv --&gt;, depicts him as [[European]], though the only extant description of his appearance by a Roman court historian states that Atilla had &quot;a flat nose, swarthy dark complexion, broad chest, short stature and small eyes, but full of confidence&quot; among his features, suggesting physical features common among [[Mongolia]]ns.]]

As late as [[450]], Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful [[Visigoth]] kingdom of [[Toulouse]] in [[military alliance|alliance]] with Emperor [[Valentinian III]]. He had previously been on good terms with the western Empire and its ''[[de facto]]'' ruler [[Flavius Aëtius]]&amp;mdash;Aetius had spent a brief [[exile]] among the Huns in [[433]], and the troops Attila provided against the [[Goths]] and [[Bagaudae]] had helped earn him the largely honorary title of ''magister militum'' in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of [[Geiseric]], who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.

However Valentinian's sister [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], in order to escape her forced betrothal to a [[Roman Senate|senator]], had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help&amp;mdash;and her [[engagement ring|ring]]&amp;mdash;in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such; he accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as [[dowry]]. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother [[Galla Placidia]] convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria; he also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, not convinced, sent an embassy to [[Ravenna]] to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

Meanwhile, Theodosius having died in a riding accident, his successor [[Marcian]] cut off the Huns' tribute in late 450; and multiple invasions, by the Huns and by others, had left the Balkans with little to plunder. The king of the [[Salian Franks]] had died, and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between Attila and Aetius: Attila supported the elder son, while Aetius supported the younger{{ref|rift}}. [[J.B. Bury]] believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom&amp;mdash;already the strongest on the continent&amp;mdash;across [[Gaul]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] shore{{ref|atlantic}}. By the time Attila had gathered his [[vassal]]s&amp;mdash;[[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Rugians]], [[Scirians]], [[Heruls]], [[Thuringians]], [[Alans]], [[Burgundians]], et al.&amp;mdash;and begun his march west, he had declared intent of alliance both with the Visigoths and with the Romans.

In [[451]], his arrival in [[Belgica]] with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong soon made his intent clear. On [[April 7]] he captured [[Metz]], and Aetius moved to oppose him, gathering troops from among the [[Franks]], the [[Burgundians]], and the [[Celts]]. A mission by [[Avitus]], and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king [[Theodoric I]] (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached [[Orleans]] ahead of Attila{{ref|orleans}}, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aetius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. The two armies clashed in the [[Battle of Chalons]], whose outcome commonly, though erroneously, is attributed to be a victory for the Gothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting. Aetius failed to press his advantage, and the alliance quickly disbanded. Attila withdrew to continue his campaign against Italy.

==Invasion of Italy and death==
Attila returned in [[452]] to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging [[Italy]] along the way; his army sacked numerous cities and razed [[Aquileia]] completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian fled from [[Ravenna]] to [[Rome]]; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle. Attila finally halted at the [[Po]], where he met an embassy including the [[prefect]] [[Trigetius]], the [[consul]] [[Aviennus]], and [[Pope Leo I]]. After the meeting he turned his army back, having claimed neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired.

[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|275px|right|[[Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' shows Leo I, with [[Saint Peter]] and Saint Paul above him, going to meet Attila]]

Several explanations for his actions have been proffered. The [[Pandemic|plague]] and [[famine]] which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken, or the troops that Marcian sent across the Danube may have given him reason to retreat, or perhaps both. [[Priscus]] reports that superstitious fear of the fate of [[Alaric I|Alaric]]&amp;mdash;who died shortly after sacking Rome in [[410]]&amp;mdash;gave the Hun pause. [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]'s pious &quot;fable which has been represented by the pencil of [[Raphael]] and the chisel of [[Algardi]]&quot; (as [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] called it) says that the Pope, aided by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], convinced him to turn away from the city. Various historians (e.g. [[Isaac Asimov]]) have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the Hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign. 

Whatever his reasons, Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube. From there he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had cut off. However, he died in the early months of [[453]]; the conventional account, from Priscus, says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage (to a beautiful Goth named [[Ildico]]), he suffered a severe [[nosebleed]] and choked to death in a stupor. An alternative to the nosebleed theory is that he succummed to internal bleeding after heavy drinking. His warriors, upon discovering his death, mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that, says Jordanes, &quot;the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men.&quot; His horsemen galloped in circles around the silken tent when Attila lay in state, singing in his [[dirge]], according to [[Cassiodorus]] and Jordanes, &quot;Who can rate this as death, when none believes it calls for vengeance?&quot; then celebrating a ''[[strava]]'' over his burial place with great feasting. He was buried in a triple coffin&amp;mdash;of gold, silver, and iron&amp;mdash;with the spoils of his conquest, and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret. After his death, he lived on as a legendary figure: the characters of ''Etzel'' in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' and ''Atli'' in both the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' were both loosely based on his life.

An alternate story of his death, first recorded eighty years after the fact by the Roman chronicler [[Count Marcellinus]], reports: &quot;''Attila rex Hunnorum Europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur.''&quot; (&quot;Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.&quot;){{ref|marcellinus}} The ''Volsunga saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda'' claim that King Atli died at the hands of his wife [[Gudrun]].{{ref|atli_death}} Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than romantic fables, preferring instead the version given by Attila's contemporary Priscus.  The &quot;official&quot; account by Priscus, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock (''The Night Attila Died: Solving the Murder of Attila the Hun'', Berkley Books, 2005 ISBN 0425202720). Based on detailed [[philological]] analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death, given by Priscus, was an ecclesiastical &quot;cover story&quot; and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from [[450]]-[[457]]) was the political force behind Attila's death.

His sons [[Ellak]] (his appointed successor), [[Dengizik]], and [[Ernakh]] fought over the division of his legacy&amp;mdash;&quot;what warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate&quot;  and, divided, were defeated and scattered the following year in the [[Battle of Nedao]] by the Gepids, under [[Ardaric]], whose pride was stirred by being treated with his people like chattel, and the Ostrogoths. Attila's empire did not outlast him.

==Appearance, character, and name==
[[Image:Atli.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Atilla. &lt;br&gt; From an illustration to the [[Poetic Edda]].]] 

The main source for information on Attila is [[Priscus]], a historian who traveled with [[Maximin]] on an embassy from Theodosius II in [[448]]. He describes the village the nomadic Huns had built and settled down in as the size of the great city with solid wooden walls. He described Attila himself as:

: ''&quot;short of stature, with a broad chest and a large head; his eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with gray; and he had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion, showing the evidences of his origin.&quot;''

Attila's physical appearance was most likely that of an [[Eastern Asia|Eastern Asian]] or more specifically a [[Mongol]], or perhaps a mixture of this type and the Turkic peoples of [[Central Asia]]. Indeed, he probably exhibited the characteristic Eastern Asian facial features, which Europeans were not used to seeing, and so they often described him in harsh terms. 

Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim &quot;Scourge of God&quot;, and his name has become a byword for cruelty and [[Barbarian|barbarism]]. Some of this may arise from a conflation of his traits, in the popular imagination, with those perceived in later [[steppe]] warlords such as the [[Mongol]] [[Great Khan]] [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur|Tamerlane]]: all run together as cruel, clever, and sanguinary lovers of battle and pillage. The reality of his character may be more complex. The Huns of Attila's era had been mingling with Roman civilization for some time, largely through the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of the border&amp;mdash;so that by the time of Theodosius's embassy in 448, Priscus could identify [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Latin]] as the three common languages of the horde. Priscus also recounts his meeting with an eastern Roman captive who had so fully [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into the Huns' way of life that he had no desire to return to his former country, and the Byzantine historian's description of Attila's humility and simplicity is unambiguous in its admiration.

The historical context of Attila's life played a large part in determining his later public image: in the waning years of the western Empire, his conflicts with Aetius (often called the &quot;last of the Romans&quot;) and the strangeness of his culture both helped dress him in the mask of the ferocious barbarian and enemy of civilization, as he has been portrayed in any number of films and other works of art. The Germanic epics in which he appears offer more nuanced depictions: he is both a noble and generous ally, as [[Etzel]] in the ''Nibelungenlied'', and a cruel miser, as Atli in the ''Volsunga Saga'' and the ''Poetic Edda''. Some national histories, though, always portray him favorably; in [[Hungary]] and [[Turkey]] the names of Attila (sometimes as Atilla in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) and his last wife Ildikó remain popular to this day. In a similar vein, the Hungarian author [[Géza Gárdonyi]]'s novel ''A láthatatlan ember'' (published in English as ''Slave of the Huns'', and largely based on Priscus) offered a sympathetic portrait of Attila as a wise and beloved leader.

The name Attila may mean &quot;Little Father&quot; in Gothic (''atta'' &quot;father&quot; plus diminutive suffix ''-la'') as many Goths were known to serve under Attila. It could also be of pre-[[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Altaic languages|Altaic]]) origin (compare it with [[Ataturk|Atatürk]] and ''Alma-Ata'', now called [[Almaty]]). It most probably originates from ''atta'' (&quot;father&quot;) and ''il'' (&quot;land&quot;), meaning &quot;Land-Father&quot;. [[Atil]] was also the [[Altaic]] name of the present-day [[Volga]] river which may have given its name to Attila.

The '''Aegean Sea''' is an arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], located between the Greek peninsula and [[Asia Minor]]. It is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosporus]].

== Etymology ==
In ancient times there were various explanations for the name Aegean. It was said to have been named after the town of [[Aegae]], or [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died. 

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the sea is {{Polytonic|Αἰγαῖον Πέλαγος}} (Aigaion Pelagos, [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]] Ejéon Pélaγos) and Ege Denizi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. A possible etymology is a derivation from the dialect word {{Polytonic|αἶγες}} (aiges) &quot;waves&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]; metaphorical use of {{Polytonic|αἴξ}} (aix) &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{Polytonic|αἰγιαλός}} (aigialos) &quot;coast&quot;.

== History ==
In ancient times the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations - the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of [[Crete]], and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Civilization of the [[Peloponnese]]. Later arose the city-states of Athens and Sparta among many others that constituted the [[Hellenic Civilization]]. The Aegean Sea was later inhabited by [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Roman Republic|Romans]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Seljuk Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and it allowed for contact between several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite Image]]
The [[Aegean islands]] can be simply divided into seven groups: the [[Thracian Sea]] group, the East Aegean group, the Northern [[Sporades]], the [[Cyclades]], the [[Saronic Islands]] (or [[Argo-Saronic Islands]]), the [[Dodecanese]] and Crete. The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to these islands. Many of the Aegean islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos Island|Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and [[Crete]] to [[Rhodes]], dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean. Many of the islands have safe harbours and bays, but navigation through the sea is generally difficult. Many of the islands are [[volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. There are two islands of considerable size belonging to [[Turkey]] on the Aegean Sea: [[Bozcaada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Τένεδος ''[[Tenedos]]'') and [[Gökçeada]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ίμβρος ''[[Imvros]]'').

The bays in gulfs counterclockwise includes on [[Crete]], the [[Mirabelli Gulf|Mirabelli]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf|Strymonian]] Gulf and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, Çandarlı Gulf, [[İzmir]] Gulf, [[Kuşadası]] Gulf, Gökova Gulf, Güllük Gulf.

==Port towns==

The Aegean Sea has many ports especially on the islands, for ports, see the island chains or its gulfs and bays.

''This article describes the novel by Anthony Burgess. For other uses of the term '''Clockwork Orange''', see '[[Clockwork Orange (disambiguation)]]'.


'''''A Clockwork Orange''''' is a [[science fiction]] and [[dystopian]] [[1962]] [[novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]], and forms the basis for the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|1971 film adaptation]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. 

It is one of Burgess's &quot;terminal novels&quot;, written to provide posthumous income for his wife after Burgess had allegedly been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.

Burgess wrote that the title came from an old [[Cockney]] expression &quot;As queer as a clockwork orange.&quot; [[#References|&amp;sup1;]] Due to his time serving the British [[Colonial Office]] in [[Malaya]], Burgess thought that the phrase could be used to punningly refer to a mechanically responsive (clockwork) non-human (orang, [[Malay language|Malay]] for &quot;person&quot;). The Italian title, &quot;Un'Arancia ad Orologeria&quot; was interpreted to refer to a grenade. Burgess wrote in his later introduction, &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked,&quot; that a creature who can only perform good or evil is &quot;a clockwork orange&amp;mdash;meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by [[god (monotheism)|God]] or the [[Devil]].&quot;

In his essay &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;[[#References|&amp;sup2;]] he says that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]], or mechanical, laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness.&quot; This title alludes to the protagonist's negatively conditioned responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will.

The book was partly inspired by an event in [[1944]], when Burgess' pregnant wife Lynne was robbed and beaten by four [[desertion |U.S. GI deserters]] in a [[London]] street, suffering a [[miscarriage]] and chronic [[gynecology|gynaecological]] problems[[#References|&amp;sup3;]].  According to Burgess, writing the novel was both a catharsis and an &quot;act of charity&quot; towards his wife's attackers - the story is narrated by and essentially sympathetic to one of the attackers rather than their victim.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Set in the near future, the book centres around the life of the fifteen year old protagonist [[Alex DeLarge]]. Alex and his gang roam the streets at night, committing crimes purely for enjoyment.  The crimes described in the book increase in severity, from assault, to robbery, to a fight with rival gang, culminating when the gang breaks into the house of F.D. Alexander and rapes his wife. The gang returns to a bar where Alex hits one of his gang members, Dim, as punishment for Dim's rude behaviour towards a woman who was singing the chorus of ''[[Ode to Joy]]'', classical music being Alex's other passion, apart from violence. This sparks off a tense moment between the two gang members.

The next day, after fighting Dim and George to re-establish his control of the gang following the previous night's dispute Alex agrees, on Pete's suggestion, to rob a house in a rich part of town. Alex tries to persuade the woman living in the house to open the door. The woman refuses and calls the police as a precaution. He gains access to the house through a window, but is confronted by the defiant woman, who defends herself with unexpected strength, he goes for a bust of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and she scratches his face, he manages to knock her out with a silver statue he had previously taken. As he runs out the front door he is struck by Dim who runs off with the rest of the gang just as the police arrive. At the police station we learn that the woman has died.

In prison, Alex hears about an experimental rehabilitation programme called &quot;the Ludovico technique&quot;, which promises that the prisoner will be released upon completion of the two week treatment and will not commit crimes afterwards and manages to become the first patient. The Ludovico technique itself is a form of [[aversion therapy]], where Alex is given a drug that induces extreme nausea while being forced to watch graphically violent films. At the end of the treatment Alex is unable to carry out or even contemplate violent acts as doing so induces crippling nausea.

He is released from prison, but upon returning home he is rejected by his parents. Dejected, Alex contemplates suicide, going to the public library in order to discover what sort of poison he might take to end his life. There he is spotted by one of his former victims, who accompanied by his friends extracts his revenge. Alex is unable to strike back and the police is alerted. The police arrive, but they turn out to be Dim, and Billy Boy, the former leader of a rival gang. They take Alex, beat him up and dump him by the side of the road out in the country.

Alex stumbles to the nearest house for help, which turns out to be that of F.D. Alexander, whose wife Alex had raped and beaten earlier in the book. At first Alex is not recognised as he had always worn a mask, but the reader discovers that F.D. Alexander is in a wheel chair and his wife died from her injuries. Realising that Alex is the same person who had attacked him and his wife some years ago, F.D. Alexander drugs him, locks him in a room and plays Beethoven’s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] at full volume. Although previously his favourite piece of music the Ninth was also used as a soundtrack for one of the films that Alex was forced to watch as part of the Ludovico treatment, hence it produces the same nauseating effects on him. Unable to stand the pain Alex throws himself out of the window to try to kill himself. He survives the fall with broken bones and wakes up in hospital informed that his tormentors have been arrested and the Ludovico treatment reversed.

The final chapter begins identically to the first, Alex having formed a new gang and reverted to his previous criminality. But on this particular night he decides not to join them and goes for a walk on his own instead. In a cafe he bumps into one of his old gang member Pete, who is married and has become a respectable member of society. Pete's wife giggles at Alex's rhetoric, and asks Pete &quot;why does he speak like that?&quot; After conversing with Pete and his wife, Alex has an epiphany, renouncing violence on one hand, but on the other concluding that his behaviour was an unavoidable part of youth, and that if he had a son, he would not be able to stop him from doing what he did.

Although the book is divided into three parts, each containing seven chapters, twenty-one being a symbolic number as it was the age that which a child earns his rights at the time, the 21st chapter was omitted from the versions published in the US. The [[Film|film]] adaptation which was directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] follows the American version of the book, ending prior the events of the 21st chapter.  Kubrick claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, but that he certainly never gave any serious consideration to using it.

==Analysis== 
The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang dialect which Burgess invented for the book, called [[nadsat]]. It is a mix of modified [[Russian_language|Russian]] words, [[English_language|English]] slang and words invented by Burgess himself. It serves two functions, firstly Burgess, while wanting to provide his young characters with their own register did not want to use contemporary slang, fearing that this would &quot;date&quot; the book too much. Secondly, the novel graphically describes horrific scenes of violence, which would be shocking even by today's standards, so nadsat is used as a &quot;linguistic veil&quot; to distance the reader from the action on the page.

==Influence==
{{main|List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange}}
Both the story and individual elements have had a strong influence on [[popular culture]] in general and [[popular music]] in particular.

==Trivia==
* Alex's age at the end of the novel is the same age that the Burgesses' miscarried child would have been at the date of publication, had the child survived the attack on Lynne, been born and grown up.
* The allegedly Cockney phrase ''A Clockwork Orange'' is totally unknown to history: the first recorded use of it is Burgess's title. Quoted in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, Burgess claimed to have first heard the expression &quot;from a very old Cockney in 1945.&quot;
*Burgess claimed that he had typed the title ''A Clockwork Orange'' and then sat down to think of a story to go with it. One early idea apparently involved a strike or riot among apprentices under Elizabeth I.
*As with many writers and their most popular books, this was one of Burgess's least favourite of the books he wrote, and he thought it was overrated.
*Since, in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' the author F. Alexander wrote a book entitled ''A Clockwork Orange'' and it is his wife who is attacked by the droogs, it seems likely Burgess directly inserted some of his own feelings and characteristics into the novel in the form of this character.

'''Amsterdam''', ({{Pronunciation|Nl-Amsterdam.ogg}}) the [[capital]] of the [[Netherlands]], lies on the banks of two bodies of water, the [[IJ (bay)|IJ bay]] and the [[Amstel]] river. Founded in the late [[12th century]] as a small fishing village on the banks of the [[Amstel]],  it is now the largest city in the country and its financial and cultural centre. As of 2005, the population of the city proper is 742,951{{ref|population}}; the population of the greater Amsterdam area is approximately one and a half million.

Amsterdam has one of the largest historic city centres in Europe, dating largely from the 17th century, the Golden Age of the Netherlands, of which it was the focal point. At this time, a series of concentric, semi-circular canals were built around the older city centre, which still defines its layout and appearance today. Many fine houses and mansions are situated along the canals; most are lived in, others are now offices, and some are public buildings.  Some of the narrow brick houses are gradually sinking because they are built on [[pile|piles]] to cope with the marshy subsoil.

The city is noted for many outstanding museums, including the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Rembrandt House Museum]], the [[Anne Frank House]], and its world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Concertgebouworkest]], whose home base is the [[Concertgebouw]]. Notable are also its [[red-light district]], ''[[de Wallen]]'', and its numerous &quot;[[coffee shop]]s&quot; selling [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

Although Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, it is neither the capital of the province in which it is located, [[North Holland]] (which is [[Haarlem]]), nor the seat of government (which is [[The Hague]]).

==History==
''Main article: [[History of Amsterdam]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam airphoto.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Historical centre]]
Amsterdam was founded as a fishing village in the [[13th century]]. According to legend Amsterdam was founded by two [[Frisian]] fishermen, who landed on the shores of the Amstel in a small boat with their dog. The damming of the river [[Amstel]] gave it its name.  It was given [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in [[1300]] or [[1301]].  From the [[14th century]] on, Amsterdam flourished, largely on the basis of trade with the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]].

The [[16th century]] brought a rebellion by the Dutch against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors, escalating into the [[Eighty Years' War]] which ultimately led to Dutch independence. The Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance and [[Jew]]s from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], prosperous merchants from [[Antwerp]] (economic and religious refugees from the part of the Low Countries still controlled by Spain), [[Huguenots]] from [[France]] (persecuted for their religion) sought safety in Amsterdam. It was the rich, refined migrants from Flanders who set the tone (their Brabant dialects became the basis of standard written Dutch) and made Holland a [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] power.

The [[17th century]] is considered Amsterdam's &quot;Golden Age&quot;.  In the early 17th century Amsterdam was the richest city in Europe. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to [[North America]], [[Africa]] and present-day [[Indonesia]] and [[Brazil]] and formed the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the biggest share in the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] and [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]]. These companies acquired the overseas possessions which formed the seeds of the later Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was the most important point for the trans-shipment of goods in Europe and it was the leading financial centre of the world. Amsterdam's stock exchange was the first to trade continuously. 

The population grew from slightly over 10,000 around 1500 to 30,000 around 1570, 60,000 around 1600, 105,000 in 1622 and almost 200,000 around 1700 (a twenty fold increase in 200 years). Thereafter, the population did not change much for another century and a half. During the century before World War II it almost quadrupled to 800,000, but then remained fairly constant again to this day.

[[Image:River Amstel by Night - Frans Koppelaar.jpg|thumb|200px|River Amstel by Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Painting by [[Frans Koppelaar|Koppelaar]]&lt;/small&gt;]]The 18th and early 19th centuries saw a decline in Amsterdam's prosperity. The wars of the Dutch Republic with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Amsterdam's fortunes reached their lowest point. However, with the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in [[1815]], things slowly began to improve. In Amsterdam new developments were started by people like [[Sarphati]] who found their inspiration in Paris.

The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the Concertgebouw were built. At this time the [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Amsterdam. The ''[[Amsterdam-Rhine Canal]]'' was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]] and the ''[[North Sea Canal]]'' to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects improved communication with the rest of Europe and the world dramatically.

[[Image:annefrankmuseum.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;font size='1'&gt;In 2004, 936,432 people visited the museum adjoining #263 Prinsengracht, better known as the Anne Frank House.&lt;/font&gt;]]
Shortly before the [[First World War]] the city began expanding and new suburbs were built. During [[World War I]], the Netherlands remained neutral. Amsterdam suffered a food shortage and heating fuel became scarce.  The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed.

Germany invaded the Netherlands in [[10 May]] [[1940]], taking control of the country after five days of fighting. The Germans installed a Nazi civilian government in Amsterdam that cooperated in the persecution of Jews.  More than 80,000 [[Jew]]s were deported to concentration camps, of whom perhaps the most famous was a young German girl, [[Anne Frank]]. Only 5,000 Jews survived the war. In the last months of the war communication with the rest of the country broke down and food and fuel became scarce. Many inhabitants of the city had to travel to the countryside to collect food. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel.

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Wapen amsterdam.jpg|frame|left]]
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of three [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]'s crosses, aligned vertically, but rotated 90 degrees for the flag. Historians believe they represent the three dangers which have traditionally plagued the city: flood, fire, and pestilence. The city's official motto, ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' (&quot;Valiant, Resolute, Merciful&quot;) which is displayed on the coat of arms, was bestowed on it by [[Queen Wilhelmina]] in 1947 in recognition of the city's bravery during World War II. The lions were added in the sixteenth century.

The crown was awarded to the city in 1489 by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], out of gratitude for services and loans. The crown was a sign of imperial protection and acted as a seal of approval for Amsterdam merchants abroad. The Westertoren also features the imperial crown.

==City government==
''Main article: [[Amsterdam (municipality)]]''

[[Image:Amsterdam 4.89943E 52.37109N.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Satellite image of Amsterdam]]

As all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a mayor, his ''wethouders'' (aldermen), and the municipal council. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into fifteen ''stadsdelen'' (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The ''stadsdelen'' are responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. Fourteen of these have their own council, chosen by a popular election. The fifteenth, Westerpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam, has very few inhabitants, and is governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.

==Academia==
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the [[Vrije Universiteit]]. Other institutions for higher education include an art school, De Rietveldacademie, the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, the Hogeschool voor Economische Studies Amsterdam and the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten, which includes the Sweelinck Conservatorium. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 1600s, is one of the oldest [[botanical garden]]s in the world, with many old and rare specimens, amongst which the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.

[[Image:Java_Island_Architecture.jpg|thumb|Java Island, in [[IJ (bay)|'t IJ]], is known for its modern architecture.]]

==Public transport==
Public transport in Amsterdam, operated by [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Connexxion]], and [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], consists of: 

* national and international [[train]] connections
* 3 [[metro]] lines and 1 [[light rail]] line, together the [[Amsterdam metro]]
* 16 [[tram]] lines
* An express tram line (IJtram)
* 55 local bus lines
* regional bus lines
* several [[ferries]] for pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (bay)|IJ]] (free of charge)
* a Fast Flying Ferry towards [[Velsen]]-Zuid on the North Sea shore

A new underground line, the [[North/South Line]] (''Noord/Zuidlijn'') is under construction. (See also [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]], [[Amsterdam metro]], [[Amsterdam Centraal]]).

===History===
During the construction of the [[Amsterdam metro]], plans to demolish the entire [[Jew]]ish neighbourhood near the [[Nieuwmarkt]] led to strong protests. The metro was still built (wall decorations at the [[Nieuwmarkt]] station are dedicated to the protests), but plans to build a highway through the neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam were abolished. In 1975 there was an incident where a planned bombing of the Venserpolder station led to a political scandal when mayor Ivo Samkalden and everyone in the city council, except for [[Roel van Duijn]], instantly and erroneously blamed the left-wing protesters, which was exactly the objective of the right-wing bombers.

[[Image:Amster.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the ubiquitous cyclists in Amsterdam]]

==Private transport==
Many people in Amsterdam use [[bicycle|bicycles]] to get around.  Most main streets have bike paths. Bike racks are ubiquitous throughout the city. In the city centre, driving a car is complicated by traffic jams and limited and expensive parking space.

==Airport==
[[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]], about twenty minutes by train from downtown Amsterdam, is the biggest airport in the Netherlands, and the fourth largest in Europe. It handles about 42 million passengers a year and is home base to [[KLM]].

==Sports==
Amsterdam is the home town of [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]], a team in the [[Dutch Football League]]. Its home base is the modern stadium [[Amsterdam ArenA]], located in the south-east of the city. The team shares that facility with the [[Amsterdam Admirals]], an [[American football]] team.

In 1928, Amsterdam hosted the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Games of the IXth Olympiad]]. The [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] built for the occasion has been completely restored and is now used for cultural and sporting events.

Amsterdam also is home to a famous [[ice rink]], the [[Jaap Eden]] baan. The [[Amstel Tijgers]] play in this arena in the Dutch [[ice hockey]] premier league. In [[speed skating]] many international championships have been fought in the 400-meter lane of this ice rink.

The city also has a [[baseball]] team, the [[Amsterdam pirates]] who play in the Dutch Major League. Three [[field hockey]] teams, Amsterdam, Pinoké and Hurley, and a [[basketball]] team, the [[Amsterdam Astronauts]] who play in the Dutch premier division and play their games in the Sporthallen Zuid, near the Olympic Stadium.

==Periodic events==
* [[Koninginnedag]], ''Queen's day'', [[30 April]], the former [[Queen_of_the_Netherlands|Queen's]] ([[Juliana_of_the_Netherlands|Juliana]]) birthday
* [[Uitmarkt]], last weekend in August, the start of the cultural season
* ''Amsterdam Roots'', last week of June. International music festival
* ''Amsterdam Pride'', mid-August, [[gay pride]] weekend
* ''Amsterdam Marathon'', mid-October
* [[Sail Amsterdam]], a five-yearly event, when [[tall ship]]s from all over the world can be visited.

[[Image:Automobiles.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A small variety of cars, the most popular kind of automobile.]]

An '''automobile'''  is a [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]] that carries its own [[motor]]. Different types of automobiles include cars, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[van]]s, and [[motorcycles]], with cars being the most popular. The term is derived from Greek 'autos' (''self'') and Latin 'movére' (''move''), referring to the fact that it 'moves by itself'. Earlier terms for automobile include '[[Brass Era car|horseless carriage]]' and 'motor car'. An automobile has seats for the [[driving|driver]] and, almost without exception, one or more passengers. It is the main source of [[transportation]] across the world.

[[As of 2005]] there are 500 million cars worldwide (0.074 per capita), of which 220 million are located in the [[United States]] (0.75 per capita).

==History==
{{main|History of the automobile}}

===The history of automobiles=== The modern automobile powered by the Otto gasoline engine was invented in Germany by [[Karl Benz]]. Even though Karl Benz is credited with the invention of the modern automobile, several other German engineers worked on building the first automobile at the same time. These inventors are: [[Karl Benz]] on [[July 3]], [[1886]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Stuttgart]] (also inventors of the first motor bike) and in 1888/89 [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrian]] inventor [[Siegfried Marcus]] in [[Vienna]], although Marcus didn't go beyond the prototype stage.
{{Automobile history eras}}

==='''Steam powered vehicles'''===
[[Steam-power]]ed self-propelled cars were devised in the late [[18th century]]. The first self-propelled car was built by [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] in [[1769]], it could attain speeds of up to 6 km/h. In [[1771]] he designed another steam-driven car, which ran so fast that it rammed into a wall, producing the world’s first [[car accident]].

===The Internal Combustion Engine===
In 1806 [[Fransois Isaac de Rivaz]], a Swiss, designed the first [[internal combustion engine]] (sometimes abbreviated &quot;ICE&quot; today). He subsequently used it to develop the world’s first vehicle to run on such an engine, one that used a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to generate [[energy]]. It was not very successful, as was the case with the British inventor, Brown, and the American inventor, Morey, who produced clumsy IC-engine-powered vehicles about 1826.

Etienne Lenoir produced the first successful internal-combustion engine in 1860, and within a few years, about 400 were in operation in Paris.  In about 1863, Lenoir installed his engine in a vehicle.  It seems to have been powered by city lighting-gas in bottles, and was said by Lenoir to have &quot;travelled slower than a man could walk, with breakdowns being frequent.&quot;  Lenoir, in his patent of 1860, included the provision of a carburettor, so liquid fuel could be substituted for gas, particularly for mobile purposes, i.e., vehicles.  Lenoir is said to have tested liquid fuel, such as alcohol, in his stationary engines; but it doesn't appear he used them in his vehicle.  If he did, he most certainly didn't use gasoline, as this was not well-known and was considered a waste product.

The next innovation comes in the late 1860s, with [[Siegfried Marcus]], a German working in Vienna, Austria.  He developed the idea of using gasoline as a fuel in a two-stroke internal-combustion engine.  In 1870, he built a crude vehicle, with no seats, steering or brakes, but it was spectacular for one reason:  it was the world's first internal-combustion-engine-powered vehicle fueled by gasoline.  It was tested in Vienna in September of 1870.  In 1888/1889, he built a second car, this one with seats, brakes and steering, and a four-stroke engine of his own design.  

The four-stroke engine had already been written down and patented in 1862 by the Frenchman Beau de Rochas in a long-winded and rambling pamphlet.  He printed about 300 copies of his pamphlet and they were distributed in Paris, but nothing came of this, with the patent expiring soon after and the pamphlet disappearing into total obscurity.  In fact, hardly anyone knew of it to begin with.  Beau de Rochas never built a single engine.  

Most historians agree that Nikolaus Otto of Germany built the world's first four-stroke engine.  He knew nothing of Beau de Rochas's patent or idea, and came upon the idea entirely on his own; in fact, he began thinking about it in 1861, but abandoned the idea until the mid-1870's. There is some evidence, although not conclusive, that one Christian Reithmann, an Austrian living in Germany, had built a four-stroke engine entirely on his own by 1873.  Reithmann had been experimenting with IC-engines as early as 1852.

In 1883, Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville and Leon Malandin of France installed an internal-combustion engine powered by a tank of city gas on a tricycle.  As they tested the vehicle, the tank hose came loose, resulting in an explosion.  In 1884, Delamare-Deboutteville and Malandin built and patented a second vehicle.  This one consisted of two four-stroke, liquid-fueled engines mounted to an old four-wheeled horse cart.  The patent, and presumably the vehicle, contained many innovations, some of which wouldn't be used for decades.  However, during the vehicle's first test, the frame broke apart, the vehicle literally &quot;shaking itself to pieces,&quot; in Malandin's own words.  No more vehicles were built by the two men, and their venture went completely unnoticed and their patent unexploited. No one else knew of the vehicles and experiments until years later.  

Supposedly in the late 1870's, an Italian named Murnigotti patented the idea of installing an IC engine on a vehicle, although there is no evidence one was built.  In 1884, Enrico Bernardi, another Italian, installed an IC engine on his son's tricycle.  Although nothing more than a toy, it is said to have operated somewhat successfully in one source, but another says the engine's power was too feeble to make the vehicle move.

But if all of the above experiments hadn't taken place, the development of the automobile wouldn't have been retarded by so much as a moment, since they were unknown experiments that went no further than the testing stage.  The internal-combustion-engined car really can be said to have begun with Benz and Daimler in 1886, for their vehicles were successful, they went into series-production, and they inspired others.

Benz, after building his first three-wheeled car in 1885, built improved versions in 1886 and 1887, and went into production in 1888 -- the world's first vehicle to do so.  Approximately 25 were built until 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced. They were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.  Because France was more open to the automobile in general, more were built and sold in France than by Benz himself in Germany. 

Daimler built a car in 1886 - a new horse carriage fitted with his new high-speed 4-stroke engine.  In 1889, he built two vehicles from scratch, with several innovations.  From about 1890-1895 about 30 vehicles were built by Daimler and his innovative assistant, Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after having a falling out with their backers.

In 1890, Emile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began series-producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the motor industry in France. They were inspired by Daimler's Stalhradwagen of 1889, which was exhibited in Paris in 1889. 

The first American automobile with gasoline-powered [[internal combustion engine]]s was supposedly designed in 1877 by [[George Baldwin Selden]] of [[Rochester, New York]], who applied for a patent on the automobile in 1879.  Selden didn't build a single car until 1905, when he was forced to do so due to the lawsuit.  Selden received his patent and later sued the Ford Motor Company for infringing his patent.  Henry Ford was notoriously against the American patent system, and Selden's case against Ford went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], who ruled that Ford and everyone else was free to build automobiles without paying royalties to Selden, since automobile technology had improved since Selden's patent, and no one was building those antiquated designs.


Meanwhile, notable advances in steam power evolved in [[Birmingham]], England by the [[Lunar Society]]. It was here that the term [[horsepower]] was first used. It was in Birmingham also that the first British four wheel [[petrol]]-driven automobiles were built in 1895 by [[Frederick William Lanchester]] who also patented the [[disc brake]] in the city. [[Electric vehicle]]s were produced by a small number of manufacturers.

===Innovation===
[[Image:Olds2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ransom E. Olds, the creator of the Assembly line]]
The first automobile [[patent]] in the [[United States]] was granted to [[Oliver Evans]] in 1789; in 1804 Evans demonstrated his first successful self-propelled vehicle, which not only was the first automobile in the US but was also the first [[amphibious vehicle]], as his steam-powered vehicle was able to travel on [[wheel]]s on land and via a [[paddle wheel]] in the water.

On [[5 November]], [[1895]], [[George B. Selden]] was granted a United States patent for a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] automobile engine ({{US patent|549160}}). This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the USA. A major breakthrough came with the historic drive of [[Bertha Benz]] in 1888. Steam, electric, and gasoline powered autos competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s.

[[Image:Bentley Continental GT dashboard.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The interior of a modern luxury car, a [[Bentley Continental GT]]]]

The large scale, [[production-line]] manufacturing of affordable automobiles was debuted by [[Oldsmobile]] in 1902, then greatly expanded by [[Henry Ford]] in the 1910s. Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric [[ignition system|ignition]] and the electric self-starter (both by [[Charles Kettering]], for the [[Cadillac (automobile)|Cadillac]] Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.

===Model changeover and design change===
[[Image:1989 Ford Sierra GLS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An English 1989 Ford Sierra GLS Sports Saloon. No longer in production]] 
[[Image:2000 Ford Taurus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Ford Taurus]], a modern family car which has gone through a number of changes.]]
Cars are not merely continually perfected mechanical contrivances; since the 1920s nearly all have been mass-produced to meet a market, so marketing plans and manufacture to meet them have often dominated automobile design. It was [[Alfred P. Sloan]] who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one firm, so that buyers could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes improved. The makes shared parts with one another so that the larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1950s, [[Chevrolet]] shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with [[Pontiac]]; the LaSalle of the 1930s, sold by [[Cadillac]], used the cheaper mechanical parts made by the Oldsmobile division.

==Alternative fuels and batteries==
{{main|Alternative fuel cars}}
With heavy [[tax]]es on fuel, particularly in [[Europe]] and tightening environmental [[law]]s, particularly in [[California]], and the possibility of further restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, work on alternative power systems for vehicles continues.

[[Diesel]]-powered cars can run with little or no modification on 100% pure [[biodiesel]], a fuel that can be made from [[vegetable oil]]s. Many cars that currently use gasoline can run on ethanol, a fuel made from plant sugars. Most cars that are designed to run on gasoline are capable of running with 15% ethanol mixed in, and with a small amount of redesign, gasoline-powered vehicles can run on ethanol concentrations as high as 85%. All petrol fuelled cars can run on [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]]. There has been some concern that the ethanol-gasoline mixtures prematurely wear down seals and gaskets.  Further, the use of higher levels of alcohol requires that the automobile carry/use twice as much.  Therefore, if your vehicle is capable of 300 miles on a 15-gallon tank, the efficiency is reduced to approximately 150 miles.  Of course, certain measures are available to increase this efficiency, such as different camshaft configurations, altering the timing/spark output of the ignition, or simply, using a larger fuel tank.

In the [[United States]], alcohol fuel was produced in corn-alcohol [[still]]s until [[Prohibition]] criminalized the production of alcohol in 1919. [[Brazil]] is the only country which produces ethanol-running cars, since the late 1970s.

Attempts at building viable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles continued throughout the 1990s (notably [[General Motors]] with the [[EV1]]), but cost, speed and inadequate driving range made them uneconomical.  Battery powered cars have used [[lead-acid batteries]] which are greatly damaged in their recharge capacity if discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis and [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH batteries]].

Current research and development is centered on &quot;[[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]]&quot; vehicles that use both electric power and internal combustion.  The first hybrid vehicle available for sale in the USA was the [[Honda Insight]].  As of 2005, The car is still in production and achieves around 60 mpg.

Other R&amp;D efforts in alternative forms of power focus on developing [[fuel cells]], alternative forms of combustion such as [[Gasoline Direct Injection|GDI]] and [[HCCI]], and even the stored energy of compressed air (see [[water Engine]]).

==Safety==

Automobiles were a significant improvement in safety on a per passenger mile basis, over the horse based travel that they replaced. Millions have been able to reach medical care much more quickly when transported by [[ambulance]].

[[Car accident|Accidents]] seem as old as automobile vehicles themselves. [[Joseph Cugnot]] crashed his steam-powered &quot;Fardier&quot; against a wall in 1770. The first recorded automobile fatality was [[Bridget Driscoll]] on [[1896-08-17]] in [[London]] and the first in the [[United States]] was [[Henry Bliss]] on [[1899-09-13]] in [[New York City, NY]].

Cars have two basic safety problems: They have human drivers who make mistakes, and the wheels lose traction near a half gravity of deceleration. [[Automated highway system|Automated control]] has been seriously proposed and successfully prototyped. Shoulder-belted passengers could tolerate a 32[[Gee|G]] emergency stop (reducing the safe intervehicle gap 64-fold) if high-speed roads incorporated a steel rail for emergency braking. Both safety modifications of the roadway are thought to be too expensive by most funding authorities, although these modifications could dramatically increase the number of vehicles that could safely use a high-speed highway.

Early safety research focused on increasing the reliability of brakes and reducing the flammability of fuel systems. For example, modern engine compartments are open at the bottom so that fuel vapors, which are heavier than air, vent to the open air. Brakes are hydraulic so that failures are slow leaks, rather than abrupt cable breaks. Systematic research on crash safety started in 1958 at [[Ford Motor Company]]. Since then, most research has focused on absorbing external crash energy with crushable panels and reducing the motion of human bodies in the passenger compartment.

There are standard tests for safety in new automobiles, like the [[EuroNCAP]] and the [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/testing/ncap/ US NCAP] tests. There are also tests run by organizations such as [http://www.hwysafety.org/ IIHS] and backed by the insurance industry.

Despite technological advances, there is still significant loss of life from car accidents: About 40,000 people die every year in the [[U.S.]], with similar figures in [[Europe]]. This figure increases annually in step with rising population and increasing travel if no measures are taken, but the rate [[per capita]] and per mile travelled decreases steadily. The death toll is expected to nearly double worldwide by 2020. A much higher number of accidents result in injury or permanent [[disability]]. The highest accident figures are reported in China and India. The European Union has a rigid program to cut the death toll in the EU in half by 2010 and member states have started implementing measures.

==Current Production==
In 2005 63 million cars and light trucks were produced worldwide. The world's biggest car producer (including light trucks) is the European Union with 29% of the world's production. In non-EU Eastern Europe another 4% are produced. The second largest manufacturer is NAFTA with 25.8%, followed by Japan with 16.7%, China with 8.1%, MERCOSUR with 3.9%, India with 2.4% and the rest of the world with 10.1%. (vda-link)

Large free trade areas like EU, NAFTA and MERCOSUR attract manufacturers worldwide to produce their products within them and without currency risks or customs, additionally to being close to customers. Thus the production figures do not show the technological ability or business skill of the areas. In fact much if not most of the Third World car production is used western technology and car models (and sometimes even complete obsolete western factories shipped to the country), which is reflected in the patent statistic as well as the locations of the r&amp;d centers.

The automobile industry is dominated by relatively few large corporations (not to be confused with the much more numerous brands), the biggest of which (by numbers of produced cars) are currently [[General Motors]], [[Toyota]] and [[Ford Motor Company]]. It is expected, that Toyota will reach the No.1 position in 2006. The most profitable per-unit carmaker of recent years has been Porsche due to their premium price tag.

The automotive industry at large still suffers from high under-utilization of its manufacturing potential.

==Future of the car==
In order to limit deaths, there has been a push for self-driving automobiles.  Much of the drive for computer-driven vehicles has been led by [[DARPA]] with their [http://www.grandchallenge.org/ Grand Challenge] race.

A current and powerful invention was ESP by Bosch and many followers that reduces deaths by about 30% and is recommended by many lawmakers and carmakers to be a standard feature in all cars sold in the EU. ESP recognizes dangerous situations and corrects the drivers input for a short moment to stabilize the car. 

The biggest threat to automobiles is the declining supply of oil, which does not completely stop car usage but makes it significantly more expensive. Beginning of 2006 a gallon of gas costs approx. 6 US$ in Germany and other European countries. If no cheap solution can be found in the relatively near future individual mobility might suffer a major setback. Nevertheless, individual mobility is highly prized in modern societies so the demand for automobiles will remain just with a different power source.

Looking at automotive technology some areas appear to have the most need of development. For example, both the rubber tires and the batteries currently used by most cars seem rather antiquated when compared to,say, modern-day engines and traction-control systems. These are like jets with cardboard wings or PCs with 10 KB hard drives respectively. While slow moving cars can control their wheels via ESP reasonably well, fast moving vehicles like a Bugatti Veyron need a special tire checkup before approaching 400 km/h. Also the existing batteries are barely fit to handle the cars electronics but are far off from the ability to store enough energy for moving the car unassisted.

'''Audi''' is an [[automobile]] maker in [[Germany]], and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The company is headquartered in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

Audi's German [[tagline]] is &quot;[[Vorsprung durch Technik]]&quot;. The [[tagline]] is used either in original or in its English translation &quot;Progress through Technology&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:Audi NSU range (1969).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Press photograph of the then newly merged Audi NSU range, 1969.]]
===The origins of Audi===
The company traces its origins back to 1899 and [[August Horch]]. The first Horch automobile was produced in 1901 in [[Zwickau]], in former [[East Germany]]. In 1910, Horch was forced out of the company he had founded. He then started a new company in Zwickau and continued using the Horch brand. His former partners sued him for [[trademark]] infringement and a German court determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. August Horch was forced to refrain from using his own [[family name]] in his new car business. As the word &quot;horch!&quot; translates to &quot;listen!&quot; in [[German language|German]], August Horch settled on the [[Latin]] equivalent of his name - &quot;audi!&quot;. It is also popularly believed that Audi is an acronym which stands for &quot;Auto Union [[Germany|Deutschland]] [[Ingolstadt]]&quot;. Audi produces over 2 million vehicles annually at its main production site in [[Ingolstadt]]. Audi has another production plant in Neckarsulm.

Audi started with a 2612 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] model followed by a four cylinder model with 3564 cc, as well as 4680 cc and 5720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. August Horch left the Audi company in 1920. The first six cylinder model (4655 cc) appeared in 1924. In 1928, the company was acquired by [[J S Rasmussen]], owner of [[DKW]], who bought the same year the remains of the US [[automobile manufacturer]], [[Rickenbacker]] including the manufacturing equipment for eight cylinder engines. These engines were used in ''Audi Zwickau'' and ''Audi Dresden'' models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six cylinder and a small four cylinder (licensed from [[Peugeot]]) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

===The Auto Union era===
In 1932 Audi merged with [[Horch]], [[DKW]] and [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]] to form the [[Auto Union]].
Before [[World War II]], Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. This badge was used, however, only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.

===Pause and a new start===
Auto Union plants were heavily bombed and partly destroyed during [[World War II]]. After the war, Zwickau soon became part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and Audi headquarters were moved to [[Ingolstadt]]. In that period, the four interlinked rings were used together with the DKW badge. The company focused efforts on the DKW brand, but their [[two-stroke]] engines became unpopular. In 1958, [[Daimler-Benz]] acquired 88 per cent of Auto Union and the next year became its sole owner. Daimler-Benz developed a 72 hp (54 kW) four-door sedan, with a modern [[four stroke engine]] driving the front wheels. This model appeared in September 1965, &quot;relaunching&quot; the Audi brand. Daimler-Benz sold the company to [[Volkswagen]] in 1964; subsequently, Volkswagen's purchase of Auto Union has led to the modernization of VW to which it gained expertise in manufacturing water-cooled vehicles.  Today, aircooled powerplants once produced by VW are no longer placed into production vehicles since December 23, 2005.  
[[image:Audi_60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi 60 (1968 - 1972)]]
In 1969, Audi merged with [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]], based in [[Neckarsulm]] near [[Stuttgart]]. In the [[1950s]] NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of [[motorcycle]]s but had moved on to produce small cars like the [[NSU Prinz]] (the TT and TTS versions are still popular as vintage race cars). NSU then focused on new rotary engines according to the ideas of [[Felix Wankel]]. In 1967, the new [[NSU Ro 80]] was a space-age car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, safety, et cetera, but teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. Presently several lines of Audi cars are produced in Neckarsulm.

The mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, was intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic Ro 80. However, Volkswagen took the K70 for its own range, spelling the end of NSU as a separate brand.

===The modern era of Audi===
[[image:audi.quatro.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi Quattro]]
[[Image:Audi.tt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Audi TT]]

The first Audi of the modern era was the [[Audi 100]] of 1968. This was soon joined by the [[Audi 80|Audi 80/Fox]] (which formed the basis for the 1973 [[Volkswagen Passat]]) in 1972.

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer [[Jorg Bensinger]] was accepted to develop the [[four-wheel drive]] technology in [[Volkswagen]]'s [[Iltis]] military vehicle for an Audi performance car and [[Rallying|rally]] racing car. The performance car was named the &quot;[[Quattro]],&quot; a turbocharged coupé which was also the first production vehicle to feature full-time all-wheel drive through a center [[differential]].  Commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot; (the &quot;[[Ur-]]&quot; prefix is a German [[augmentative]] used, in this case, to mean &quot;original&quot; and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's S4 and S6 sport sedans, as in &quot;UrS4&quot; and &quot;UrS6&quot;), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team) but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology,  

In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of &quot;grandfather's car&quot; image, the type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant [[Audi 90]], which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early nineties, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

This decline in sales was not helped in the [[United States|USA]] by a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report which purported to show that Audi automobiles suffered from &quot;unintended acceleration&quot;. The ''60 Minutes'' report was based on customer reports of acceleration when the brake pedal was pushed. Independent investigators concluded that this was most likely due to a close placement of the accelerator and brake pedals (unlike American cars), and the inability, when not paying attention, to distinguish between the two. (In race cars, when manually downshifting under heavy braking, the accelerator has to be used in order to match revs properly, so both pedals have to be close to each other to be operated by the right foot at once, toes on the brake, heels on the gas. US citizens are used to automatic gearboxes and only two well separated pedals). This was never an issue in Europe, as Europeans in general use manual transmission gears, and have a &quot;feeling&quot; for vehicle revs in comparison to the speed of the car.

''60 Minutes'' ignored this fact and rigged a car to perform in an uncontrolled manner. The report immediately crushed Audi sales, and Audi renamed the affected model (The 5000 became the 100/200 in 1989, as in Germany and elsewhere). Audi had contemplated withdrawing from the American market until sales began to recover in the mid-1990s. The turning point for Audi was the sale of the new A4 in 1996, and with the release of the A4/6/8 series, which was developed together with VW and other sister brands (so called &quot;platforms&quot;).

Currently, Audi's sales are growing strongly in Europe, and the company is renowned for having the best build quality of any mainstream auto manufacturer. 2004 marked the 11th straight increase in sales, selling 779,441 vehicles worldwide. Record figures were recorded from 21 out of about 50 major sales markets. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). In March of 2005, Audi is building its first two dealerships in India following its high increase in sales in that region. Though its brand still doesn't have the global cachet of [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[BMW]], Audi's reputation for quality and understated style has once again made it a highly desirable marque.

However, after 2003, with the release of the new A4, and in 2004 with the new A6, Audi's dedication to quality had finally paid off when it started to receive news reports and various vehicle critics praising Audis over [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]].

==Auto racing==
Audi has competed in (and sometimes dominated) numerous forms of [[auto racing]]. Audi's rich tradition in motorsport began with the [[Auto Union]] in the 1930s. In the 1990s Audi dominated the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing Stateside. 

===Rallying===
In 1980 Audi released the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]], an [[all wheel drive]] turbocharged car that went on to win [[rally racing|rallies]] and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of all-wheel-drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of all-wheel-drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was an instant success, winning its first rally on its first outing. It won competition after competition for the next two years.

In 1984 Audi launched the &quot;[[Quattro|Sport Quattro]]&quot; car which dominated races in [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Sweden]] with Audi taking all podium finishes but succumbed to problems further into [[WRC|World Rally Championship]] contention. After another season mired in mediocre finishes, Walter Röhrl finished the season in his Sport Quattro S1 and helped place Audi second in the manufacturer's points. Audi also received rally honors in the [[Hong Kong]] to [[Beijing]] rally in that same year. Michèle Mouton, the first female WRC driver to win a championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the S1 and raced in the [[Pikes Peak|Pikes Peak Hill Climb]]. The climb race pits a driver and car to drive up a 4,302 meter high mountain in [[Colorado]] and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39 and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In 1986, Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in Portugal involving driver Joaquim Santos in his RS200. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. [[Bobby Unser]] used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

===Motorsports in the USA===
In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1 he retired from the WRC in 2 years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested 5-cylinder turbo charged engine and generated over 600 hp (447 kW). The engine was mated to a 6-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous all-wheel drive system. All of Audi's top drivers drove this beast, Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and the female driver, Michèle Mouton. The Audi S1 enjoys a 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) time of 2.3 s. This Audi S1 started the S-series of cars for Audi which now represents an increased level of sports options and quality to the Audi line up.

As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose first into America with the [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] in 1988, 

In 1989, Audi moved to [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA GTO]] with the [[Audi 90|90]], however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title. 
===Touring cars===
In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in the United States, Audi returned to Europe turning first to the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|DTM]] series with the [[Audi V8]], then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast growing [[Supertouring]] series, which took place nationally, first in the [[French Supertourisme]] and [[Italian Superturismo]]. In the following year, Audi would switched to the German [[Super Tourenwagen]] (known as STW) and then to [[BTCC]] (British Touring Car Championship) the year after that.

The [[FIA]], having difficulty regulating the Quattro system and what impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four wheel drive cars from competiting in 1998, by then Audi switched all their works efforts to sportscar racing.

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their [[Audi RS4|RS4]] for the [[SPEED World Challenge|SCCA Speed World GT Challenge]], through dealer/team [[Champion Racing]] competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an [[Audi RS6|RS6]]. Once again, the quattro was superior and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title but a newcomer, Cadillac, gave them a run for their money.  After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance.

In 2004, after years of competiting with the TT-R in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team [[Abt|Abt Racing]] taking the 2002 title with [[Laurent Aiello]], Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported [[Joest Racing]] [[Audi A4|A4s]].

===Sports car racing===
Beginning in 1999, Audi built the [[Audi R8 Race Car|Audi R8]] to compete in [[sports car racing]], including the [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP900]] class at the [[24 hours of Le Mans]]. The factory supported Joest Racing team won at Le Mans three times in a row (2000 - 2002), as well as winning every race in the [[American Le Mans]] Series in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as [[Champion Racing]]. In 2003, two [[Bentley]] [[Bentley Speed 8|Speed 8]]s, with engines designed by Audi and driven by Joest drivers ''loaned'' to the fellow VW company, competed in the GTP class and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's circle at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans, Champion Racing entered two R8s along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team [[Oreca]].  The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a more narrow air inlet restrictor, cutting power, and an additional 50 kg of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis.  On average, the R8s were about 2-3 seconds off pace compared to the [[Pescarolo]]-[[Judd]].  But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third while the ORECA team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GT's in 1967.  This also ends the long era of the R8, however its replacement for 2006, called the [[Audi R10]], was unveiled on December 13, 2005. the R10 employs many new features, including a twin-turbocharged diesel engine. Its first race will likely be the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring as a race-test for the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Technology==
Audi is the only car manufacturer that produces 100% [[galvanize]]d vehicles to prevent corrosion. Along with other precautionary measures, the thus achieved full-body [[zinc]] coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust and [[corrosion perforation]]. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year [[warranty]] against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years. An all-[[aluminium]] car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the Audi A8 was launched, which introduced aluminium [[space frame]] technology. Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-nineties and continues to pursue leading-edge technology and high performance.

The all-aluminium concept was extended to the company's new [[sub-compact]], the [[Audi A2]] which was launched in 2001.

In the 1970's, some vehicle manufacturers including Audi (and [[Subaru]]) designed their own [[all wheel drive]] systems in passenger vehicles. In the 1980's, all-wheel drive systems in cars became a fad, and other manufacturers like [[Porsche]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] offered all-wheel drive systems in their cars to compete in the marketplace. Unfortunately, the all-wheel drive system in the Mercedes-Benz vehicles were riddled with problems right from the design sheet. The system also was not popular in Porsche vehicles because owners wanted the traditional performance of the [[rear wheel drive]] they got used to in older Porsches. Although Porsche and Mercedes-Benz offer all-wheel drive systems in some cars today, neither manufacturer was able to ride the fad and come out on top like Audi has. Today, after many decades of class-leading technology and engineering, the name ''[[quattro]]'' is an identifiable symbol and trademark that shows would-be competitors the level of quality they have to achieve in order to attempt to compete with Audi.

In the 1980s, Audi was the champion of the inline 5 cylinder, [[Engine displacement|2.1/2.2 L]] engine as a longer lasting alternative to more traditional 6 cylinder engines. This engine was used in not only production cars but also their race cars. The 2.1 L inline 5 cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980's, providing well over 400 [[horsepower]] (298 kW) after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity was a good combination of good fuel economy which was on the mind of every motorist in the 1980's, and a good amount of power the customer wants.
Through the early 1990's, Audi began to move more towards the position of being a real competitor in it's target market against Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorprated in the bonnet. 

By 1991, Audi had the 4 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 80]], the 5 cylinder [[Audi 80|Audi 90]] and [[Audi 100|Audi 100]], the turbocharged [[Audi 100|Audi 200]] and the [[Audi V8|Audi V8]]. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4 and 5 cylinder engines.

Although the five cylinder engine was a successful and very robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8l V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines, in sedan, coupe and cabriolet body styles.

The 5 cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice, however a turbocharged 230BHP (169kW) version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi Coupe and named the S2 and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the [[Audi S4|S4]]. These two models were the beginning of the mass produced S series of performance cars.

The [[Audi A8|Audi A8]] replaced the [[Audi V8|V8]] in 1994, with a revolutionary Aluminium Space Frame (ASF) to save weight. The weight reduction was offset by the quattro all-wheel drive system, however it meant the car had similar performance to its rivals, but far superior handling.

The next major model change was in 1995 when the [[Audi A4|Audi A4]] replaced the [[Audi 80|Audi 80]]. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the Audi A6 (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the [[Audi S6|S6]] and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The [[Audi Cabriolet]] continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new [[Audi A3|A3]] (based on the [[VW Golf|Volkswagen Golf]]) was introduced to the range in 1997, and the radical [[Audi TT|TT]] coupe and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings. Another interesting model introduced was the [[Mercedes Benz|Mercedes-Benz]] A-Class competitor, the [[Audi A2|Audi A2]]. The model sold relatively well in Europe, however Audi decided not to develop a new model and it has since been discontinued as of 2004.

The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L 4 cylinder, 1.8 turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L V6, 2.2 L turbo-charged 5 cylinder and the 4.2 L V8. The V6's were replaced by new 2.4 and 2.8 L 30V V6's in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L W12 for the A8.

At the turn of the century, Audi introduced the [[direct shift gearbox]] (DSG), a manual transmission driveable like an automatic transmission. The system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled clutches instead of a [[torque converter]]. This is implemented in some [[Volkswagen Golf]], [[Audi A3]] and [[Audi TT|TT]] models. The engine range was continually upgraded, with a 2.7 L twin turbo V6 being offered in the Audi S4, A6 and allroad, the 2.8 L V6 was replaced by a 3.0 L unit.

New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the 1.8 L engine now 2.0 L and the 3.0 L V6 is now 3.1 L in size. Audi has now introduced [[FSI|FSI]] on some of their engines, including the 1.6 L 4 cylinder, a new 2.0 L (Audi was the first manufacturer in the world to utilize a turbo charger and FSI on the same powerplant), and the 3.1 L V6. This is a direct fuel-injection technique that Audi had also used on its diesel engines since the early 1980s.

As a premium member of the VW Group, technologies are frequently first introduced to the mass market with Audi vehicles before being 'trickled down' to more value oriented brands such as VW, [[SEAT]] and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]]. Recent examples of this include DSG and FSI.

Audi now has an impressive range of cars, engines and transmissions available, which continue to lead the way and introduce new technologies into the market.

An '''aircraft''' is any [[machine]] capable of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[flight]].

&lt;!--English word &quot;aircraft&quot; is singuar and plural with no &quot;s&quot;. See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt;
==Categories and classification==
Aircraft fall into two broad categories: 

===Heavier than air===
Heavier than air [[aerodyne]]s, including  [[autogyro]]s, [[helicopter]]s and variants, and conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft]] (airplanes or aeroplanes). Fixed-wing aircraft generally use an [[internal-combustion engine]] in the form of a [[piston engine]] (with a [[propeller]]) or a [[Turbine|turbine engine]] ([[Jet engine|jet]] or [[turboprop]]), to provide [[thrust]] that moves the craft forward through the air. The movement of air over the airfoil produces [[lift (force)|lift]] that causes the  aircraft to fly. Exceptions are [[glider]]s which have no engines and gain their thrust, initially, from [[winch]]es or tugs and then from gravity and thermal currents. For a glider to maintain its forward speed it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Helicopters and autogyros use a spinning rotor (a ''rotary wing'') to provide lift; helicopters also use the rotor to provide thrust. The abbreviation [[VTOL]] is applied to aircraft other than helicopters that can take off or land vertically. [[STOL]] stands for Short Take Off and Landing.

===Lighter than air===
[[image:yellow.balloon.takesoff.in.bath.arp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A hot air balloon takes off from Royal Victoria Park, Bath, England]]

[[Lighter than air]] [[aerostat]]s: [[hot air balloon]]s and [[airship]]s. Aerostats use [[buoyancy]] to float in the air in much the same manner as ships float on the water.  In particular, these aircraft use a relatively low density gas such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]] or heated air, to displace the air around the craft. The distinction between a balloon and an airship is that an airship has some means of controlling both its forward motion and steering itself, while balloons are carried along with the wind.

===Types of aircraft===
:''See also: [[List of aircraft]]''

There are several ways to classify aircraft. Below, we describe classifications by design, propulsion and usage.

====By design====
[[image:Size-comparison.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A size Comparation of some of the largest airplanes in the world. The Airbus A380-800, the Boeing 747-400 (largest airliner to date) The Antonov An-225 (aircraft with the greatest payload) and the Hughes H-4 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; (largest airplane in the world) designed by the famous [[Howard Hughes]] ]]
A first division by design among aircraft is between lighter-than-air, '''aerostat''', and heavier-than-air aircraft, '''aerodyne'''.

Examples of lighter-than-air aircraft include non-steerable [[balloon]]s, such as [[hot air balloon]]s and [[gas balloon]]s, and steerable [[airship]]s (sometimes called dirigible balloons) such as [[blimp]]s (that have non-rigid construction) and [[rigid airship|rigid airships]] that have an internal frame. The most successful type of rigid airship was the [[Zeppelin]].  Several accidents,  such as the [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] fire at [[Lakehurst]], NJ, in [[1937]] led to the demise of large rigid airships.

In heavier-than-air aircraft, there are two ways to produce lift: aerodynamic lift and engine lift. In the case of aerodynamic lift, the aircraft is kept in the air by wings or rotors (see [[aerodynamics]]). With engine lift, the aircraft defeats gravity by use of [[vertical]] 
Examples of engine lift aircraft are [[rocket]]s, and [[VTOL]] aircraft such as the [[Hawker-Siddeley Harrier]].

Among aerodynamically lifted aircraft, most fall in the category of [[fixed-wing aircraft]], where horizontal airfoils produce [[lift (force)|lift]], by profiting from airflow patterns determined by [[Bernoulli's equation]] and, to some extent, the [[Coanda effect]].

The forerunner of these type of aircraft is the [[Kite flying|kite]]. Kites depend upon the tension between the cord which anchors it to the ground and the force of the [[wind]] currents.  Much aerodynamic work was done with kites until test aircraft, wind tunnels and now computer modelling programs became available.  

In a &quot;conventional&quot; configuration, the lift surfaces are placed in front of a control surface or [[tailplane]]. The other configuration is the [[canard]] where small horizontal control surfaces are placed forward of the wings, near the nose of the aircraft. Canards are becoming more common as [[supersonic]] [[aerodynamic]]s grows more mature and because the forward surface contributes lift during straight-and-level flight.

The number of lift surfaces varied in the pre-[[1950]] period, as [[biplane]]s (two wings) and [[triplane]]s (three wings) were numerous in the early days of aviation. Subsequently most aircraft are [[monoplane]]s. This is principally an improvement in [[structure]]s and not aerodynamics.

Other possibilities include the [[delta-wing]], where lift and horizontal control surfaces are often combined, and the [[flying wing]], where there is no separate vertical control surface (e.g. the [[B-2 Spirit]]).

A variable geometry ('swing-wing') has also been employed in a few examples of combat aircraft (the [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]], [[Panavia Tornado]], [[F-14 Tomcat]] and [[B-1 Lancer]], among others).

The [[lifting body]] configuration is where the body itself produce lift. So far the only significant practical application of the lifting body is in the [[Space Shuttle]], but many aircraft generate lift from nothing other than wings alone.

A second category of aerodynamically lifted aircraft are the [[rotary-wing aircraft]]. Here, the lift is provided by rotating [[aerofoil]]s or [[rotor]]s. The best-known examples are the [[helicopter]], the [[autogyro]] and the [[tiltrotor]] aircraft (such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]). Some craft have reaction-powered rotors with gas jets at the tips but most have one or more lift rotors powered from engine-driven shafts.

A further category might encompass the [[ground effect|wing-in-ground-effect]] types, for example the Russian [[ekranoplan]] also nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot; and [[hovercraft]]; most of the latter employing a skirt and achieving limited ground or water clearance to reduce friction and achieve speeds above those achieved by [[boat]]s of similar weight.

A recent innovation is a completely new class of aircraft, the [[fan wing]]. This uses a fixed wing with a forced airflow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above. It is (2005) in development in the [[United Kingdom]].

And finally the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] is a category of its own. These designs may have potential but are not yet practical.

====By propulsion====
[[Image:WestCoastAirFloatplane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[turboprop]]-engined [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DeHavilland Twin Otter]] adapted as a [[floatplane]].]]
Some types of aircraft, such as the balloon or [[glider]], do not have any propulsion. Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude).  For gliders, takeoff takes place from a high location, or the aircraft is pulled into the air by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or towed aloft by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft.  [[Airship]]s combine a balloon's [[buoyancy]] with some kind of propulsion, usually [[propeller]] driven.

Until [[World War II]], the [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engine]] was virtually the only type of propulsion used for powered aircraft. (See also: [[Aircraft engine]].)  The piston engine is still used in the majority of aircraft produced, since it is efficient at the lower altitudes used by small aircraft, but the [[radial engine]] (with the cylinders arranged in a circle around the [[crankshaft]]) has largely given way to the [[horizontally-opposed engine]] (with the cylinders lined up on two sides of the crankshaft).  Water cooled [[V engine]]s, as used in automobiles, were common in high speed aircraft, until they were replaced by jet and turbine power.  Piston engines typically operate using [[avgas]] or regular gasoline, though some new ones are being designed to operate on diesel or jet fuel.  Piston engines normally become less efficient above 7,000-8,000 ft (2100-2400 m) above sea level because there is less oxygen available for combustion; to solve that problem, some piston engines have mechanically powered compressors (blowers) or turbine-powered [[turbocharger]]s or turbonormalizers that compress the air before feeding it into the engine; these piston engines can often operate efficiently at 20,000 ft (6100 m) above sea level or higher, altitudes that require the use of supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurisation. 
During the forties and especially following the [[1973 energy crisis]], development work was done on propellers with swept tips or even scimitar-shaped blades for use in high-speed commercial and military transports.

Pressurised aircraft, however, are more likely to use the [[turbine|turbine engine]], since it is naturally efficient at higher altitudes and can operate above 40,000 ft. Helicopters also typically use turbine engines.  In addition to turbine engines like the [[turboprop]] and [[jet engine|turbojet]], other types of high-altitude, high-performance engines have included the [[ramjet]] and the [[pulse jet]].  [[Rocket aircraft]] have occasionally been experimented with. They are restricted to rather specialised niches, such as [[spaceflight]], where no oxygen is available for combustion (rockets carry their own oxygen).

====By usage====
The major distinction in aircraft usage is between [[military aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for military purposes (such as combat, patrolling, search and rescue, reconnaissance, transport, and training), and [[civil aviation]], which includes all uses of aircraft for non-military purposes.  

=====[[Military aircraft]]=====
[[Image:4781.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A prototype of [[Hindustan Aeronautics]]' [[Light Combat Aircraft]].]]
Combat aircraft like fighters or bombers represent only a minority of the category.  Many civil aircraft have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civil [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner, which became the military [[C-47]]/C-53/R4D transport in the U.S. military and the &quot;Dakota&quot; in the U.K. and the [[Commonwealth]].  Even the small fabric-covered two-seater [[Piper Cub|Piper J3 Cub]] had a military version, the L-4 liaison, observation and trainer aircraft.  In the past, gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], and cargo gliders were used during [[World War II]] to land intruding German troops in a few European countries in the 1940-42 period, while Allied troops used them in landings on [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]], 1943, and in Western Europe [France and Holland] on [[D-Day]] (the [[Normandy]] 6 June 1944 [[Operation Overlord]] invasion) and in [[Operation Anvil-Dragoon]] (1944) and in [[Operation Market Garden]] (1944).  

Combat aircraft themselves, though used a handful of times for reconnaissance and [[surveillance aircraft|surveillance]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], did not come into widespread use until the [[Balkan War]] when [[first air-dropped bomb]] was invented and widely used by [[Bulgarian air force]] against [[Turkey]]. During [[World War I]] many types of aircraft were adapted for attacking the ground or enemy vehicles/ships/guns/aircraft, and the first aircraft designed as [[bomber]]s were born. In order to prevent the enemy from bombing, [[fighter aircraft]] were developed to intercept and shoot down enemy aircraft. [[Tanker (aircraft)|Tanker]]s were developed after [[World War II]] to refuel other aircraft in mid-air, thus increasing their operational range.  By the time of the [[Vietnam War]], [[helicopter]]s had come into widespread military use, especially for transporting, supplying, and supporting ground troops.

=====Civil aviation=====
[[image:heli.g-code.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bell 206|Bell 206B JetRanger III]] '''[[helicopter]]''']]
Civil aviation includes both scheduled airline flights and [[general aviation]], a catch-all covering other kinds of private and commercial use.  The vast majority of flights flown around the world each day belong to the general aviation category, ranging from recreational balloon flying to civilian flight training to business trips to firefighting to medevac flights to cargo transportation on [[freight aircraft]].

Within general aviation, the major distinction is between private flights (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial flights (where the pilot is paid by a customer or employer).  Private pilots use aircraft primarily for personal travel, business travel, or recreation. Usually these private pilots own their own aircraft and take out loans from banks or specialized lenders to purchase them. Commercial general aviation pilots use aircraft for a wide range of tasks, such as flight training, pipeline surveying, passenger and freight transport, policing, crop dusting, and medical transport ([[medevac]]). Piston-powered propeller aircraft (single-engine or twin-engine) are especially common for both private and commercial general aviation, but even private pilots occasionally own and operate helicopters like the [[Bell 206|Bell JetRanger]] or turboprops like the [[Beechcraft King Air]]. Business jets are typically flown by commercial pilots, although there is a new generation of small jets arriving soon for private pilots.

'''Aphex Twin''' (born '''Richard David James''', [[August 18]], [[1971]], [[Ireland]]) is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[electronic music]] artist, credited with pushing forward the genres of [[techno music|techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]],  [[Acid (electronic music)|acid]], and [[drum and bass]]. He has been described as &quot;the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music&quot; ([http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html]).

==Biography==
Richard David James was born to [[Wales|Welsh]] parents Lorna and Derek James in [[1971]] in [[Limerick, Ireland]]. James spent his childhood in [[Cornwall, United Kingdom]]. As a teenager, he became a [[DJ]] and [[musician]] on the local [[rave party|rave]] scene, taking on the [[moniker]] &quot;Aphex Twin&quot;. James formed the [[Rephlex Records]] label in [[1991]] with his friend [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] and released his first records on this label, as well as [[Mighty Force]] and [[R&amp;S Records]] of [[Belgium]]. After success with his early work, James relocated to [[London]] and released a slew of albums and [[EP (format)|EPs]] on the [[Warp Records]] label, under a bewildering set of aliases (from AFX and Polygon Window to the lesser known Gak and Power Pill). 

In [[1996]], he began releasing more material composed on computers, and embraced a more [[drum and bass]] sound mixed with a nostalgic childhood theme and strange computer generated acid lines. The early adoption of [[Native Instruments]]' softsynthesizers predated the later popularity of using computers to make music. The late 1990s saw his music become more popular and mainstream, as he released two singles, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which were shown on [[MTV]] and the covers of music magazines including [[NME]].

In [[2001]] Aphex Twin released his most personal album yet, ''[[drukqs]]'', a 2-CD album which featured [[prepared piano]] songs under the influence of [[Erik Satie]] and [[John Cage]]. Also included were abrasive, fast, and meticulously programmed computer-made songs. The level of detail and artistry was so high, that reviewers and fans complained that the music was less in the style of innovative pop music, and more about detailed beautiful and personal musical art.  ''[[drukqs]]'' is perhaps Richard's most controversial album to date; the album lacked the novelty found in his other albums, so reviewers guessed this album was released as a contract breaker with Warp Records - a credible guess, as James' next big release came out on his own Rephlex label. It is also rumored that the album drukqs was released as it was because he had almost all of these songs on a creative jukebox that he forgot and left on a plane, and in fear of all of the tracks being leaked to the internet, its release was rushed as to avoid this.

In late 2004, rumours of James' return to a more [[acid techno]] based sound were realised with the ''[[Analord]]'' series. For these records, James used his extensive collection of [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[drum machine]]s which he bought when they were still at bargain prices. Also he used one of the rarest, and most desirable [[synthesizer]]s of his generation, the [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/syntonfenix883.htm Synton Fenix], and the notoriously difficult to program [[Roland MC-4]] [[sequencer]] (a sequencer with a reputation for excellent timing), as well as the infamous [[Roland TB-303]] for his trademark acid melodies.

Apart from music, Richard D. James is a talented [[photography|photographer]], having done his own artwork direction for many of his albums. On the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; single, James hid a picture of his face (created most likely with [http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.html Metasynth]) in the second track (commonly referred to as &quot;[Formula]&quot;, &quot;[Symbol]&quot;, or &quot;[Equation]&quot;), which can be seen in a [http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,52426,00.html spectral] [http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php analysis] of the track. The picture illustrates his famous toothy, evil grin.

===Aphex Twin's influences===

James has stated in numerous interviews that he has no musical influences other than himself. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html] He claims to have listened rarely to songs on the [[radio]] as a child and that he is unable to read [[Musical notation|sheet music]].

Conversely, James has said that he has listened to many bands and artists for inspiration and sampling (notably [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] for their [[Break (music)|breaks]] (used as break beats), but he has also expressed appreciation for [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]). He signed fellow musicans and personal friends Tom &quot;[[Squarepusher]]&quot; Jenkinson and Mike Paradinas ([[µ-ziq]]) to his [[Rephlex Records|Rephlex]] record label, as well as [[Luke Vibert]].

Other debated influences include:

&lt;!--Please keep list alphabetical--&gt;
* [[808 State]] for whom he has done remix work.
* [[John Cage]] and his [[prepared piano]] technique (itself inspired by [[Henry Cowell]] and [[Erik Satie]] independently) in the piano pieces on ''Drukqs''
* [[Coil (band)|Coil]]
* [[Tod Dockstader]] An electronic musician who worked with tape, mangling sounds into music of the frequency and dynamics spectrum.
* [[Mike Dred]]  Acid Techno pioneer and [[Techno]] [[Electroacoustic]] hybrid pioneer (together with Peter Green) on Dred's &quot;Machine Codes&quot; label.  James is quoted as saying that he listened to Dred &amp; Green's ''Virtual Farmer'' LP 21 times in a row when he first heard it.
* [[Brian Eno]] pioneer of ambient music, and for the artwork of his ambient records.
* [[Larry Heard]] (One song on ''Analord 02'' is called Laricheard, an obvious [[pun]] on the names Larry Heard and Richard, as the song resembles Mr. Fingers/Larry Heard track &quot;Amnesia&quot;.)
* [[Kraftwerk]] and their electropop styles.
* Kevin 'Master Reese' Saunderson
* [[Derrick May]] Techno pioneer.
* [[Joe Meek]], especially ''I Heard A New World'' album of this pioneering 1960s UK producer.
* [[Erik Satie]] whose melodic style was borrowed on ''Drukqs''.
* [[Squarepusher]] and [[Luke Vibert]] for their extreme versions of drum and bass.

===Influence of Aphex Twin on others===
Fans and journalists coined the genre names [[intelligent dance music|IDM]] and [[drill and bass]] to describe Aphex Twin's novel approach to dance music. Richard's own Rephlex Records label, which he co-owns with [[Grant Wilson-Claridge]] prefers the term &quot;Braindance&quot;.

These labels have proven useful for upcoming artists looking to find a genre name for their own music, influenced by Aphex Twin and Warp Records. In Aphex Twin's words on the 'Intelligent Dance Music' label: &quot;I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.&quot;

Aphex Twin tends to distance himself from rock/pop music, yet he has still had an influence on the rock bands like  [[Radiohead]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Peace Burial at Sea]]. Aphex Twin dismissed going on tour with Radiohead: &quot;I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them.&quot;[http://www.kludgemagazine.com/interviews.php?id=82]

==Aphex Twin's press==
Aphex Twin press interviews are generally entertaining, eccentric, and confusing. 

Aphex Twin has a reputation for lying in interviews, which he has [http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,563163,00.html admitted] to the Guardian newspaper. It is now been confirmed that Richard does own a tank (actually a 1950s armoured scout car, the [[Daimler]] Ferret Mark 3), a [[submarine]] bought from Russia, composing ambient techno at age 13 (contradicting most music history), having &quot;over 100 hours&quot; of unreleased music (including songs on his [[answering machine]] that could be wiped away by leaving a message), being able to incorporate [[lucid dreaming]] into the process of making music.
He lives in a converted bank in SE16 London, which was formerly the Bank of Cyprus and then HSBC.

It has now been confirmed by Richard`s close friends that he has built his own synthesizers and samplers from scratch in his early years. Richard once built a sampler box for his degree in microelectronics, and a photograph and article of it was taken for a UK electronic music magazine Future music. Richard is experienced in electronics and electricity, and has modified and [[circuit bending|circuit bent]] his equipment from a young age.

He has made his own software to compose with, including algorithmic processes which automatically generate beats and melodies.

{{Audio|sv-Alfred_Nobel.ogg|'''Alfred Bernhard Nobel'''}} ([[October 21]], [[1833]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] &amp;ndash; [[December 10]], [[1896]], [[San Remo, Italy]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]  chemist, engineer, pacifist, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the [[inventor]] of [[dynamite]]. He owned [[Bofors]], a major armaments manufacturer, that he had redirected from its previous role as an iron and steel mill. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[synthetic element]] [[Nobelium]] was named after him.

==Personal background==
Alfred Nobel, a descendant of the 17th century scientist, [[Olaus Rudbeck]] (1630-1702), was the third son of [[Immanuel Nobel]] (1801-1872). Born in [[Stockholm]], he went with his family at an early age to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], where his father (who had invented modern [[plywood]]) started a [[naval mine|&quot;torpedo&quot;]] works. In 1859 this was left to the care of the second son, [[Ludvig Nobel|Ludvig Emmanuel]] (1831-1888), by whom it was greatly enlarged, and Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of [[explosives]], and especially to the safe manufacture and use of [[nitroglycerine]] (discovered in 1847 by [[Ascanio Sobrero]], one of his  fellow-students under [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] at the [[University of Torino]]). Several explosions were reported at their family-owned factory in [[Heleneborg, Sweden|Heleneborg]], and a disastrous one in 1864 killed Alfred's younger brother Emil and several other workers.

Less well known is that Alfred Nobel was also a playwright. His only play, ''[[Nemesis (Nobel)|Nemesis]]'', a prose tragedy in four acts about [[Beatrice Cenci]], partly inspired by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s blank verse tragedy in five acts [[The Cenci]], was printed when he was dying, and the whole stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish-[[Esperanto]]) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has not yet (May 2003) been translated into any language other than Esperanto. 

Alfred Nobel is buried in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in [[Stockholm]].

== Dynamite ==
Nobel found that when [[nitroglycerin]] was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like [[diatomaceous earth|kieselguhr]] (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to manipulate, and this mixture he [[patent]]ed in 1867 as [[dynamite]]. 

He next combined nitroglycerin with another high explosive, [[gun-cotton]], and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a still more powerful explosive than dynamite. [[Gelignite|Blasting gelatin]], as it was called, was patented in 1876, and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of [[potassium nitrate]], wood-pulp and various other substances. 

Some years later Nobel produced [[ballistite]], one of the earliest of the nitroglycerin [[smokeless gunpowder]]s, containing in its latest forms about equal parts of gun-cotton and nitroglycerin. This powder was a precursor of [[cordite]], and Nobel's claim that his patent covered the latter was the occasion of vigorously contested law-suits between him and the [[United Kingdom|British]] Government in 1894 and 1895. Cordite also consists of nitroglycerin and gun-cotton, but the form of the latter which its inventors wished to use was the most highly nitrated variety, which is not soluble in mixtures of [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]], whereas Nobel contemplated using a less nitrated form, which is soluble in such mixtures. The question was complicated by the fact that it is in practice impossible to prepare either of these two forms without admixture of the other; eventually the courts decided against Nobel. Cordite became a mainstay munition of the British empire throughout the late 19th and early 20th century.

From the manufacture of dynamite and other explosives, and from the exploitation of the [[Baky|Baku]] oil-fields, in the development of which he and his brothers, Ludvig and Robert Hjalmar (1829-1896), took a leading part, he amassed an immense fortune.

==Armaments Manufacturer==
A less well remembered aspect of his life was his role in setting up a major armaments manufacturer, [[Bofors]] Defence AB. He was Bofors most famous owner, and owned the company from 1894 until his death in December of 1896. He had the key role in reshaping this iron manufacturer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry.

Bofors went on to become a major supplier of howitzers, cannons and field guns to armies around the world, including the USA and many Third-World dictatorships.

== The Prizes ==

The erroneous publication in 1888 of a [[List of premature obituaries|premature obituary]] of Nobel by a French newspaper, condemning his invention of dynamite, is said to have made him decide to leave a better legacy to the world after his death.

On [[November 27]], [[1895]] at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[Paris]], Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the [[Nobel Prize]]s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a [[stroke]] on [[December 10]], [[1896]] at [[San Remo]], [[Italy]].  The amount set aside for the Nobel Prize foundation was 31 million kronor.

The first three of these prizes are for eminence in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physical science]], in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]] and in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|medical science or physiology]]; the fourth is for the most remarkable [[Nobel Prize for Literature|literary work]] &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and [[Nobel Peace Prize|the fifth]] is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international brother/sisterhood, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of [[peace]] congresses.

The formulation about the literary prize, &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (Swedish ''i idealisk riktning''), is cryptic and has caused much consternation. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (in Swedish ''idealistisk''), and used it as a pretext to not give the prize to important but less [[Romanticism|romantic]] authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. This interpretation has been revised, and the prize given to, for example, [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]], who definitely do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

When reading ''Nemesis'' in its original Swedish and looking at his own philosophical and literary standpoint, it seems possible that his intention might have been rather the opposite of that first believed - that the prize should be given to authors who fight for their ideals ''against'' such authorities as God, Church and State.

There was also quite a lot of room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament he stipulated that the money should go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but he had not left instructions on how to do the split between science and technology.  Since the deciding bodies he had chosen in these domains were more concerned with science than technology it is not surprising that the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.  In a sense the technological prizes announced recently by the [[World Technology Network]] are an indirect (and thus not funded by the Nobel foundation) continuation of the wishes of Nobel, as he set them out in his testament.

In 2001, his great-grandnephew, Peter, asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel's memory&quot; from the five other awards.  This has caused much controversy whether the prize for [[Economics]] is actually a &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; (see [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]).

==Nobel Prize rumors==
* There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics. A common legend states that Nobel decided against a prize in mathematics because a woman he proposed to (or his wife, or his mistress) rejected him or cheated on him with a famous mathematician, often claimed to be [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]]. There is no historical evidence to support the story, and Nobel was never married.

'''Alexander Graham Bell''' ([[March 3]], [[1847]] &amp;ndash; [[August 2]], [[1922]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]]-[[United States|American]] [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].  Today, he is still widely considered to be the inventor of the [[telephone]], although this matter has become [[Invention of the telephone#Controversy|controversial]], with a number of people claiming that [[Antonio Meucci]] was the 'real' inventor and others holding out for [[Elisha Gray]], the founder of the [[Western Electric]] Manufacturing Company. In addition to his work in [[telecommunications]] technology, he was responsible for important advances in [[aviation]] and [[hydrofoil]] technology.

==Biography==
Born '''Alexander Bell''' in [[Edinburgh]], he later adopted the middle name ''Graham'' out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a family friend.  Many called him &quot;the father of the Deaf.&quot;  This title is somewhat ironic due to his belief in the practice of Eugenics.  He hoped to one day eradicate deafness from the population.

His family was associated with the teaching of [[elocution]]: his grandfather in [[London]], his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, [[Alexander Melville Bell]], in Edinburgh, were all professed elocutionists. The latter has published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are well known, especially his treatise on [[Visible Speech]], which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. In this he explains his method of instructing [[deaf mutes]], by means of their [[eyesight]], how to articulate words, and also how to read what other persons are saying by the motions of their [[lip]]s.

Alexander Graham Bell was educated at the [[Royal High School]] of Edinburgh, from which he graduated at the age of 13. At the age of 16 he secured a position as a pupil-teacher of elocution and music in [[Weston House Academy]], at [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], [[Moray]], Scotland. The next year he spent at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  He was graduated from University College London.

From 1866 to 1867, he was an instructor at [[Somersetshire College]] at [[Bath, England|Bath]], [[Somerset]], [[England]].

While still in Scotland he is said to have turned his attention to the science of [[acoustics]], with a view to ameliorate the deafness of his mother.

In 1870, at the age of 23, he [[emigrated]] with his family to [[Canada]] where they settled at [[Brantford]]. Before he left Scotland, Bell had turned his attention to [[telephony]], and in Canada he continued an interest in communication machines. He designed a piano which could transmit its music to a distance by means of electricity. In 1873, he accompanied his father to [[Montreal]], Canada, where he was employed in teaching the system of visible speech. The elder Bell was invited to introduce the system into a large day-school for mutes at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], but he declined the post in favor of his son, who became Professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at [[Boston University]]'s School of Oratory. 

[[Image:1876 Bell Speaking into Telephone.jpg|thumb|Bell speaking into prototype model of the telephone]]
At [[Boston University]] he continued his research in the same field, and endeavored to produce a telephone which would not only send musical notes, but articulate speech. With financing from his American father-in-law, on [[March 7]], [[1876]], the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] granted him [[Patent]] Number 174,465 covering &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;, the [[telephone]].

After obtaining the patent for the telephone, Bell continued his many experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone-transmission of sound on a beam of [[light]] &amp;mdash; a precursor of today's [[fiber optics|optical fiber]] systems. He also worked in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the eighteen patents granted in his name alone and the twelve he shared with his collaborators. These included fourteen for the telephone and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for hydroairplanes, and two for a [[selenium]] cell.

Bell had many great ideas that are now real inventions.  During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record, as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the computer, and the CD-ROM. 

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his [[Canada|Canadian]] estate in [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]], [[Nova Scotia]], he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses. 

In 1882, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1888, he was one of the founding members of the [[National Geographic Society]] and became its second president. He was the recipient of many honors. The [[France|French Government]] conferred on him the decoration of the [[Légion d'honneur]] (Legion of Honor), the [[Académie française]] bestowed on him the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 francs, the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London awarded him the [[Albert medal]] in 1902, and the University of [[Würzburg]], [[Bavaria]], granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the [[AIEE]]'s [[Edison Medal]] in 1914 for &quot;For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone.&quot;

Bell married Mabel Hubbard, who was one of his pupils at Boston University, as well as a deaf-mute, on [[July 11]], [[1877]]. His invention of the telephone was actually a device he was trying to create that would allow him to communicate with his wife and his deaf mother. He died at Beinn Bhreagh, located on [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Cape Breton Island]] near the village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]], in 1922 and is buried alongside his wife atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. He was survived by two of their four children.

Bell was listed among the [[100 Greatest Britons]], [[The Greatest American|the 100 Greatest Americans]] and in the top ten [[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadians]], the only person to be on more than one list. 

====Bell and decibel====
The ''bel'' (B) is a unit of measurement invented by [[Bell Labs]] and named after Bell. The bel was too large for everyday use, so the [[decibel]] (dB), equal to 0.1 B, became more commonly used.
The dB is commonly used as a unit for measuring sound intensity.

===The photophone===
Another of Bell's inventions was the [[photophone]], a device enabling the transmission of sound over a beam of light, which he developed together with [[Charles Sumner Tainter]]. The device employed light-sensitive cells of crystalline [[selenium]], which has the property that its [[electrical resistance]] varies inversely with the illumination (i.e., the resistance is higher when the material is in the dark, and lower when it is lighted). The basic principle was to modulate a beam of light directed at a receiver made of crystalline selenium, to which a [[telephone]] was attached. The modulation was done either by means of a vibrating mirror, or a rotating disk periodically obscuring the light beam.

This idea was by no means new. Selenium had been discovered by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1817, and the peculiar properties of crystalline or granulate selenium were discovered by [[Willoughby Smith]] in 1873. In 1878, one writer with the initials J.F.W. from [[Kew]] described such an arrangement in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in a column appearing on [[June 13]], asking the readers whether any experiments in that direction had already been done. In his paper on the photophone, Bell credited one [[A. C. Browne]] of [[London]] with the independent discovery in 1878&amp;mdash;the same year Bell became aware of the idea. Bell and Tainter, however, were apparently the first to perform a successful experiment, by no means any easy task, as they even had to produce the selenium cells with the desired resistance characteristics themselves.

In one experiment in [[Washington, D.C.]] the sender and the receiver were placed on different buildings some 700 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] (213 [[metre]]s) apart. The sender consisted of a mirror directing sunlight onto the mouthpiece, where the light beam was modulated by a vibrating mirror, focused by a [[optical device|lens]] and directed at the receiver, which was simply a [[parabolic]] reflector with the selenium cells in the [[focus]] and the telephone attached. With this setup, Bell and Tainter succeeded to communicate clearly.

The photophone was [[patent]]ed on [[December 18]] [[1880]], but the quality of communication remained poor and the research was not pursued by Bell.

===Metal detector===
Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was hurriedly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Garfield]]. The metal detector worked, but didn't find the bullet because the metal bedframe the President was lying on confused the instrument. Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in August 1882.  Though unsuccessful in its first incarnation, this achievement would eventually change the nature of physical security.

===Experimental aircraft===
Bell was also interested in [[aircraft]] and was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]]. The Association was officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia in October 1907 at the suggestion of Mrs. Mabel Bell and with her financial support. It was headed by the inventor himself. The founding members were four young men, American [[Glenn Curtiss|Glenn H. Curtiss]], a motorcycle manufacturer who would later be awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere and later be world-renowned as an airplane manufacturer; [[Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin]], the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in [[Hammondsport, New York]]; J.A.D. McCurdy; and Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], an official observer of the U.S. government. One of the project's inventions, the [[aileron]], is a standard component of aircraft today. (Note that the aileron was also invented independently by [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].)

In 1909, Bell's ''[[Silver Dart]]'' made the first controlled powered flight in Canada. However, a series of Canadian flights failed to interest the Canadian military in developing the airplane.

===The hydrofoil===
The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American [[hydrofoil]] pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils. Bell considered the invention of the [[Hydrofoil|hydroplane]] as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.

Bell and Casey Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910&amp;ndash;1911 Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck a number of designs were tried culminating in the HD-4, using Renault engines.  A top speed of 54 miles per hour was achieved, with rapid acceleration, good stability and steering, and the ability to take waves without difficulty. 
Bell's report to the navy permitted him to obtain two 350 [[horsepower]] (260 [[Watt|kW]]) engines in July 1919. On [[September 9]] [[1919]] the HD-4 set a world's marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour. This record stood for ten years.

==Eugenics==
Along with many very prominent thinkers and scientists of the time, Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisors to the [[Eugenics Record Office]] associated with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in [[New York]], and regularly attended meetings. In 1921 he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race&quot;. 

Much of his thoughts about people he considered defective centered on the deaf because of his long contact with them in relation to his work in [[deaf education]]. In addition to advocating sterilization of the deaf, Bell wished to prohibit deaf teachers from being allowed to teach in schools for the deaf, he worked to  outlaw the marriage of deaf individuals to one another, and he was an ardent supporter of [[oralism]] over [[manualism]]. His avowed goal was to eradicate the language and culture of the deaf so as to force them to integrate into the hearing culture for their own long-term benefit and for the benefit of society at large. Although this attitude is widely seen as paternalistic and arrogant today, it was accepted in that era.

Although he supported what many would consider harsh and inhumane policies today, he was not unkind to deaf individuals who proved his theories of oralism. He was a personal and longtime friend of [[Helen Keller]], and his wife Mabel was deaf, though none of their children were. Bell was well known as a kindly father and loving family man who took great pleasure playing with his many grandchildren.

== Tribute ==

In the early 1970s, UK Rock Group [[The Sweet]] recorded a tribute to Bell and the telephone, suitably titled &quot;Alexander Graham Bell&quot;. The song tells a fictional account of the invention, in which Bell devises the telephone so he can talk to his girlfriend who lives on the other side of the United States from him. The song reached the top 40 in the UK and went on to sell over one million recordings world-wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Amhrán na bhFiann'''''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Although usually sung in the [[Irish language]], a translation of the original, it is also known by the English-language title, '''''A Soldier's Song''''', as well as '''The National Anthem of Ireland''' ('''Amhrán Náisiúnta na hÉireann'''). The lyrics of the song are by [[Peadar Kearney]] and the music by both Kearney and [[Patrick Heeney]]. It was composed in [[1907]] and was first published in ''[[Irish Freedom]]'' in [[1912]]. The [[Irish language]] version of the original was the work of [[Bulmer Hobson]]. 

The song is regarded by many [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] as the national anthem of the whole of [[Ireland]], and it is therefore sung, for example, at [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] matches held anywhere on the island. [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]s, however, reject this use of ''Amhrán na bhFiann'', and at international games played by the all-Ireland [[Ireland national rugby union team|Irish Rugby Football Union]] team the song ''[[Ireland's Call]]'' is sung instead of, or (in the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as well as, ''Amhrán na bhFiann''.

==History==
''Amhrán na bhFiann'' was relatively unknown until it was sung by rebels in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) during the [[Easter Rising]] of [[1916]], and afterwards in British internment camps. The song became the official state anthem in [[1926]] when it replaced the unofficial anthem, ''[[God Save Ireland]]''. 

''[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]'' was the official anthem of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until the independent [[Irish Free State]] was established in [[1922]]. The continued use of ''God Save the King'' by some Irish people caused embarrassment to the new Irish state and, on one famous occasion, [[James McNeill|Governor-General James McNeill]] refused to attend a public function in [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] when he discovered that the university intended playing the anthem during his visit. Even after the adoption of ''Amhrán na bhFiann'' as the official anthem of the Irish Free State in July [[1926]], a minority continued to sing the British anthem, and to pray for the King and Queen in religious ceremonies, for a number of years.

In [[1934]], the Irish state acquired the copyright of the song for the sum of £1,200.[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/gen121934a.html] 

Controversy also surrounds the change in the wording of ''Amhrán na bhFiann'' over the years. In the original translation, the first line read as ''Sinne Laochra Gaedheal'' (literally &quot;we the heroes of Ireland&quot;). This has since been replaced by ''Sinne Fianna Fáil'', which to some people is evidence that the anthem has been hijacked by the [[Fianna Fáil]] party.[http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/letters/2005/1101/]

In recent years, a number of Irish newspapers and columnists have proposed replacing ''Amhrán na bhFiann'' with a new national anthem, arguing that the current wording is excessively militant and anti-[[United Kingdom|British]]. Others have argued that the melody is difficult for bands to play. Problems have sometimes been witnessed at international sporting events, where either the entire song (not just the chorus that constitutes the anthem) has been played (as occurred, for example, at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics]]) or the right part has been played but at the wrong speed, as occurred at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics]] in [[2000]]. 

Some have proposed that the anthem be replaced with the Irish Rugby Football Union's song, ''Ireland's Call''. The suggestion has also been made that, as occurred in [[Germany]] after [[World War II]], the government might change the words of the anthem while keeping the original melody.

==Lyrics==
The Irish national anthem consists of the chorus only of ''Amhrán na bhFiann'', and is almost always sung in Irish. The first two lines of the anthem and the last two, played together, form the Irish ''Presidential Salute'', which is played when the [[President of Ireland]] attends official events. The chorus of ''Amhrán na bhFiann'', as used for the anthem, is given below.

===Irish version===
:Sinne Fianna Fáil
:Atá faoi gheall ag Éirinn,
:Buíon dár slua
:Thar toinn do ráinig chughainn,
:Faoi mhóid bheith saor.
:Sean-tír ár sinsear feasta
:Ní fhágfar faoin tiorán ná faoin tráill
:Anocht a théam sa bhearna baoil,
:Le gean ar Ghaeil chun báis nó saoil
:Le gunna scréach faoi lámhach na bpiléar
:Seo libh canaig Amhrán na bhFiann.

===Phonetic version===
:shin-na fee-in-na fall
:a-thaw fay yeol egg erin

===English version===
:Soldiers are we
:whose lives are pledged to Ireland;
:Some have come
:from a land beyond the wave.
:Sworn to be free,
:No more our ancient sireland
:Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
:Tonight we man the ''bearna baoil'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:In Erin's cause, come woe or weal;
:'Mid cannon's roar and rifles' peal,
:We'll chant a soldier's song.

:In valley green, on towering crag,
:Our fathers fought before us,
:And conquered 'neath the same old flag
:That's proudly floating o'er us.
:We're children of a fighting race,
:That never yet has known disgrace,
:And as we march, the foe to face,
:We'll chant a soldier's song. 

:Chorus 

:Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale!
:The long watched day is breaking;
:The serried ranks of Inisfail
:Shall set the Tyrant quaking.
:Our camp fires now are burning low;
:See in the east a silv'ry glow,
:Out yonder waits the Saxon foe,
:So chant a soldier's song. 

:Chorus

'''Anatolia''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: &quot;Anadolu&quot;,[[Greek language|Greek]]: &quot;Aνατολή&quot; ''Αnatolē'' or Ανατολία ''Anatolìa'') is a region of [[Southwest Asia]] which corresponds today to the [[Asia]]n portion of [[Turkey]], as opposed to the [[Europe]]an portion, [[Rumelia]]. It means &quot;rising of the sun&quot; or &quot;East&quot;. The Turkish word '''Anadolu''' derives from the original Greek version.  It also often called by the [[Latin]] name of '''Asia Minor'''.
 
Because of its strategic location at the intersection of Asia and [[Europe]], Anatolia has been a cradle for several [[civilization]]s since [[prehistoric]] ages, with [[Neolithic]]  settlements such as [[Çatalhöyük]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[Çayönü]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] to pottery Neolithic), [[Nevali Cori]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), [[Hacilar]] (Pottery Neolithic), [[Göbekli Tepe]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]) and [[Mersin]]. The settlement of [[Troy]] starts in the Neolithic and continues forward into the Iron Age.
Major civilizations and peoples that have settled in or conquered Anatolia include the [[Colchians]], [[Hattians]], [[Luwian]]s, [[Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Cimmerian]]s, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Persians]], [[Celt]]s, [[Tabal]]s, [[Meshech]]s, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Pelasgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Kurds]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Seljuk Turks]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. These peoples belonged to many varied [[ethnic]] and [[linguistic]] traditions. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken both [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] languages, as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages have radiated. Other authors have proposed an Anatolian origin for the [[Etruscans]] of ancient [[Italy]].

Today the inhabitants of Anatolia are mostly native speakers of the [[Turkish language]], which was introduced with the conquest of Anatolia by [[Turkic peoples]] and the rise of the [[Seljuk Empire]] in the [[11th century]]. However, Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early [[20th century]] (see [[Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). The Turks in [[Thrace]] were forced to leave their homes and settle in Anatolia during the [[Balkan Wars]]. The last population exchange, as result of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], between Turkey and Greece eliminated the majority of Turks in Greece and Greeks in Turkey. A significant [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] ethnic and linguistic minority exists in the south eastern regions, while [[Armenian people|Armenians]] have a waning presence in the northeast and in cities.

== States of Anatolia ==
Anatolia has been the center of many great states throughout history. The first known state was built by Hittites.

== Ottoman Rule of Asia Minor after 1885==
After 1885, with the governing reforms of [[Tanzimat]], the control of the Ottoman land in Asia Minor divided into 15 [[vilayet]]s, one [[sanjak]] and one mutersaflik of the vilayet of [[Constantinople]] (both being on the asiatic side of the [[Bosporus]]).

Every vilayet was further divided in a number of sanjaks.

More specifically the political division of Asia Minor in 1915 was as follows;

* Vilayet of [[Izmir]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Manisa]], Izmir, [[Aydin]], [[Denizli]], [[Mentese]]
* Independent vilayet of the [[Dardanelles]]
* Vilayet of [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Balikesir]], Bursa, Erdogrul, [[Kutahya]], [[Afyon]]
* Vilayet of [[Konya]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Burdur]], [[Hamid abad]], [[Atalya]], Konya, [[Nigde]]
* Vilayet of [[Kastamonu]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Bolu]], [[Cankiri]], Kastamonu, [[Sinop]]
* Vilayet of [[Ankara]] divided in the sanjaks of Ankara, [[Kirsehir]], [[Yozgat]], [[Kayseri]]
* Vilayet of [[Adana]], divided in the sanjaks of Icel([[Mersin]]), Adana, Hozan, Jebel-i-Bereket
* Vilayet of [[Sivas]] divided in the sanjaks of Sivas, [[Tokat]], [[Amasya]], Karahisar-Sarki
* Vilayet of [[Trabzon]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Samsun]], Trabzon, Argiropolis, [[Lazistan]]
* Vilayet of [[Erzurum]]
* Vilayet of [[Bitlis]] divided in the sanjaks of [[Mus]], Ghen, [[Siirt]]
* Vilayet of [[Van]] divided in the sanjaks of Van, [[Hakkari]]
* Vilayet of Mosul divided in the sanjaks of Mosul, Sehrizan, Suleymanih
* Vilayet of Mamure-ul-Azil divided in the sanjak of [[Diyarbakir]] and the mutersaflik of Zor
* Vilayet of Halep divided in the sanjaks of Halep, [[Urfa]], [[Kahramanmaraş|Maras]]
Also the
* Independent mutersaflik of [[Izmit]] and
* the sanjak of [[Uskudar]]

== Ethnic distribution in Asia Minor in the early 20th century (before the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]) ==

Based on French [[census]] files of [[1915]] the total population of Asia Minor (not including [[Eastern Thrace]], the vilayets of the orient &amp; the city of Constantinople) was 10,372,411 persons of all nationalities and religions.

More specifically the distribution of differerent [[ethnic group]]s as per [[Vilayet]] and [[Sanjak]] is as follows;

'''Apple Computer, Inc.  '''({{nasdaq|AAPL}} and {{lse|ACP}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer]] technology company. Its headquarters are located at 1 [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]], part of [[Silicon Valley]]. Apple was a major player in the [[personal computer]] revolution in the 1970s.

The [[Apple II]] [[microcomputer]], introduced in 1977, was a hit with home users. In 1983, Apple introduced the first commercial personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. In 1984, Apple introduced the revolutionary [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. The Macintosh (commonly called the &quot;Mac&quot;) was the first successful commercial implementation of a GUI, which is now used in all major computers.

Apple is known for its innovative, well-designed hardware and software, such as the [[Apple iPod | iPod]] and the [[iMac]], as well as the well-known [[iTunes]] application (part of the [[iLife]] suite) and [[Mac OS X]], its current [[operating system]]. 

==History==
{{main|History of Apple Computer}}


===1976 to 1980 - The founding of Apple===
Apple Computer was founded in [[Los Gatos, California]] on [[April 1]], [[1976]] by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Ronald Wayne]], to sell the [[Apple I]] personal computer kit at $666.66. They were hand-built in Jobs' parents' garage, and the Apple I was first shown to the public at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. 

Jobs and Wozniak, (&quot;the two Steves&quot;) had been friends since 1971. Jobs managed to interest Wozniak in assembling a personal computer and selling it. Jobs approached a local computer store, The Byte Shop, who, after Jobs' famous persuasion, ordered fifty units and paid $500 for each unit. Jobs then ordered components from Cramer Electronics, a national electronic parts distributor. Using a variety of methods, including borrowing space from friends and family and selling various items including a [[VW Type 2|Volkswagen Type 2 bus]], Jobs managed to secure the parts needed while Wozniak and another friend, [[Ronald Wayne]], assembled the Apple I. They were delivered in June, and paid for on delivery. Eventually 200 Apple I computers were built.

Note that the original Apple I was actually a motherboard, it was not a full computer as we know it today.

The [[Apple II]] was introduced on [[April 16]], [[1977]] at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It was popular with home users and was occasionally sold to business users, particularly after the release of the first spreadsheet for any computer called [[VisiCalc]]. (See the timeline for dates of Apple II family model releases&amp;mdash;the 1977 Apple II and its younger siblings, the II Plus, IIe, IIc and IIGS.) But it was a mild success for the small computer company.

By now, Jobs and his partners had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The Apple II was succeeded by the [[Apple III]] in May 1980 as the company struggled to compete against [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the lucrative business and corporate computing market. The designers of the Apple III were forced to comply with Jobs' request to omit the cooling fan, and this ultimately resulted in thousands of recalled units due to overheating. An updated version was introduced in 1983 but it was also a failure due to bad press and discouraged buyers. Nevertheless, the principals of the company persevered with further innovations and marketing.

Jobs and several other Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979, to see the [[Alto (computer)|Alto computer]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for selling them one million dollars in pre-[[IPO]] Apple stock (approximately $18 million net).

===1981 to 1989 - Lisa and Macintosh===
[[Image:Ad_apple_1984.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The protagonist of Apple's well known [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 ad]], set in a [[dystopia]]n future modeled after the [[Orwellian]] novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]].]]
In the early 1980s, IBM and Microsoft continued to gain market share at Apple's expense in the personal computer industry. Using a fundamentally different business model, [[IBM]] marketed an open hardware standard created with the [[IBM PC]], which was bundled with [[Microsoft]]'s [[MS-DOS]] (MicroSoft-Disk Operating System). In 1983, Apple introduced the first [[personal computer]] to be sold to the public with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), named the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. Using a GUI, the user communicates with the computer by interacting with icons onscreen that resemble real-world items (folders, documents, images). However, the Lisa was a commercial failure as a result of its high price tag ($9995) and limited software titles.

After the Lisa, Apple began work on a similar but less expensive computer to be called the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. It was launched in 1984 with the now famous [[1984 (television commercial)|Super Bowl advertisement]] based on [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''. It was an immediate success, particularly in the world of graphic and communications design, where its [[GUI]] (which was to become the industry standard) and ability to handle large graphic files surpassed anything else on the market. The Macintosh also spawned the concept of [[Apple evangelist|Mac evangelism]] among users, which was pioneered by Apple employee and later Apple Fellow, [[Guy Kawasaki]]. 

In anticipation of the Macintosh launch, [[Bill Gates]], co-founder and chairman of [[Microsoft]], was given several Macintosh prototypes in 1983 to develop software for the &quot;Mac&quot;. In 1985, Microsoft launched [[Microsoft Windows]], with its own GUI for IBM PCs using many of the elements of the Macintosh OS.

An internal power struggle developed between Jobs and new CEO [[John Sculley]] in 1985. Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs was asked to resign from the company. Jobs then founded [[NeXT]] Inc., a computer company that built machines with futuristic designs and ran the UNIX-derived [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] operating system. Although powerful, NeXT computers never caught on with buyers, due in part to their high purchase price.

===1990 to 1993 - PowerBook and decline===
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple turned to industrial designers and adopted a product strategy based in three portable devices. One portable was built by [[Sony]], which had a strong reputation for designing small, durable and functional electronics devices. Sony took the specs of the Mac Portable, put in a smaller two-hour battery, a much smaller (physically) twenty [[megabyte]] [[Hard disk|hard drive]] and a smaller nine-inch [[Liquid crystal display|passive matrix screen]]. 

Called the [[Powerbook|PowerBook 100]], this landmark product was introduced in 1991 and established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the [[laptop computer]]. This solidified Apple's reputation as a quality manufacturer, both of desktop and now portable machines. The success of the PowerBook and several other Apple products during this period led to increasing revenue. The [[magazine]] ''[[MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 to 1991 the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh. 

This golden age was not to last. The introduction of [[Microsoft Windows]] presented an interface that many people thought was close enough to the Macintosh in terms of ease of use and overall look and feel. Apple thought that Windows was ''too'' close, and sued [[Microsoft]] for theft of intellectual property.

At about the same time, Apple branched out into consumer electronics. One example of this product diversification was the [[Apple QuickTake]] digital camera (which never caught on). A more famous example was the [[Apple Newton|Newton]], an early [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] that was introduced in 1993. Though it failed commercially, it defined and launched the new category of computing and was a forerunner and inspiration of devices such as [[BlackBerry]], [[Palm Pilot]] and its descendants-[[PocketPC]]s.

During the 1990s, Apple greatly expanded its computer lineup as well. It offered a multitude of different models, yet it failed to adequately explain to the public why it should choose one model over another.

The costs involved in making such a wide variety of products, coupled with some highly-publicized product recalls and the growing popularity of Microsoft Windows, all lead to the near-bankruptcy of Apple in the mid-to-late 1990s.


=== 1994 to 1997 - Attempts at reinvention ===

By the mid-1990s, Apple realized that it had to reinvent the Macintosh in order to stay competitive in the computer world. The needs of both computer users and computer programs were becoming, for a variety of technical reasons, harder for the existing hardware and operating system to address.

In 1994, Apple surprised its loyalists by allying with its long-time competitor IBM and Motorola in the so-called [[AIM alliance]]. This was a bid to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] or PReP) which would use IBM and [[Motorola]] hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft, which had become Apple's chief competitor.

Towards this end, Apple tried to recruit other companies that would build PReP-compliant computers. Apple hoped to expand the Mac OS market share by licensing the operating system to these other companies, like Microsoft had promoted DOS and Windows by licensing them to external manufacturers. Only a few companies--notably [[Power Computing]] and [[UMAX]]--agreed to produce these computers. But eventually the licensing program was suspended.

As the first step toward launching the PReP platform, Apple started the [[Power Macintosh]] line in 1994, using IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor. This processor utilized a [[RISC]] architecture, which differed substantially from the Motorola [[68k]] series that had been used by all previous Macs. Apple's OS's were rewritten so that most software for the older Macs could run on the PowerPC series (in [[emulation]]).

Also throughout the mid to late 1990s, Apple tried to improve its operating system's multitasking and memory management. After first attempting to modify its existing code, Apple realized that it would be better to start with an entirely new operating system and then modify it to fit the Macintosh interface. Apple did some preliminary work with IBM towards this goal with the [[Taligent]] project, but that project never produced a replacement operating system. They then investigated using [[Be Incorporated|Be]]'s [[BeOS]], [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTstep]] OS, and also Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] OS. NeXTstep was chosen, and this supplied the platform for the modern OS X.

On [[February 4]], [[1997]], Apple completed its purchase of NeXT and its NeXTstep operating system, thus bringing Steve Jobs back into Apple. On [[July 9]], [[1997]], [[Gil Amelio]] was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors after overseeing a 12-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses, despite an outstanding decade of innovation. Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO and began a critical restructuring of the company's product line.

===1998 to 2005 - New beginnings===
[[Image:Steve Jobs with iMac.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Steve Jobs]] introducing the original [[iMac]] computer in 1998.]]
In 1998, a year after Jobs had returned to the company, Apple introduced a new all-in-one Macintosh (echoing the original [[Macintosh 128K]]): the [[iMac]], a new design that eliminated most Apple-standard connections like [[SCSI]] and [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] in favor of two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. While technically not impressive (it was aimed at a general market), it featured an innovative new design - its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue (color)|Bondi Blue]] and [[white]], and later many other colors, is considered an industrial design hallmark of the late-[[1990s|90s]]. 

The iMac design team was led by Jonathan Ive (who later also designed the iPod).  The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 1998, making the company a profit that year of $309 million - Apple's first profitable year since [[Michael Spindler]] took the position of CEO of the company in 1993. The Power Macintosh was redesigned along similar lines, and continues to evolve to this day.

At the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] Apple purchased the Final Cut software from [[Macromedia]], beginning their entry into the [[digital video]] editing market. [[iMovie]] was released in [[1999]], for consumers, and [[Final Cut Pro]] was released for professionals in the same year. Final Cut Pro has gone on to be a significant video editing program. Similarly, in [[2000]], Apple bought [[Astarte]]'s DVDirector software, which morphed into [[iDVD]] (for consumers) and [[DVD Studio Pro]] (for professionals) at the [[Macworld Conference and Expo]] of [[2001]].

In 2001, Apple introduced [[Mac OS X]], the operating system based on NeXT's [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTstep]] and [[BSD]] Unix. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Apple claims that OS X marries stability, reliability and security of the [[Unix]] operating system with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To aid users in moving their applications from OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of [[Mac OS 9]] applications through OS X's [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic environment]]. Apple's [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] API also allowed developers to adapt their OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features with a (claimed) simple re-compile.

[[Image:Applecomputerheadquarters.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Company headquarters on [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]] in [[Cupertino]], [[California]].]]
In May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of the [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple retail store]]s, to be located in major U.S. consumer locations. These stores were designed for two purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to counter a poor record of marketing Apple products by third-party retail outlets.

In late 2001, Apple introduced its first [[iPod]] portable [[digital audio player]], a move that has proven to be phenomenally successful with over 42 million units sold even though it was not originally perceived to be a successful product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4625262.stm BBC News story on Apple's first quarter 2006 earnings report]&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a scheme to offer downloadable songs at US 99 cents per song through Apple's [[ITunes Music Store|iTunes Music Store]], there had been over [http://www.apple.com/itunes/1billion/ 1,000,000,000] downloads for iPod players by February 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf06/ Steve Jobs' January 2006 MacWorld keynote address]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In [[2002]], Apple purchased [[Nothing Real]], and their advanced digital compositing application, [[Shake (software)|Shake]], raising Apple's professional commitment even higher. In the same year they also acquired [[Emagic]], and with it, obtained their professional-quality music productivity application, [[Logic Pro|Logic]], which led to the development of their consumer-level [[GarageBand]] application. With [[iPhoto]]'s release in 2002 as well, this completed Apple's collection of consumer and professional level creativity software, with the consumer-level applications being collected together into the [[iLife]] suite.

On March 10, 2005 Apple Computer announced its support for [[Sony]]'s [[Blu-Ray]] technology and joined the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], or BDA. In a keynote address on [[June 6]], [[2005]], Steve Jobs officially announced that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Apple press release [http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs confirmed [[Mac rumors community|rumor]]s that the company had secretly been producing versions of its current operating system [[Mac OS X]] for both PowerPC and Intel processors for the previous five years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. 

Jobs surprised the industry at Macworld 2006 however, by announcing the first Intel based Apple computers would begin selling January 2006 and that the transition would be complete by the end of that same year. Mac OS X is based on [[OPENSTEP]], an operating system originally available for many platforms. Apple's own [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the [[open source]] underpinnings of OS X, is also compiled for Intel's ''x''86 architecture.&lt;ref&gt;See articles from [http://news.com.com/Apple+shakes+hands+with+Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html news.com], [http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1112 Apple insider], and [http://nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/06apple.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of the [[Power Mac G5]] in [[June 2003]], Apple abandoned flashy colors in favor of white [[polycarbonate]] for consumer lines such as the iMac and iBook, as well as the educational [[eMac]], and anodized [[aluminum]] or [[titanium]] for professional products like the [[Power Mac G5]], [[PowerBook G4]] and [[MacBook Pro]], as well as the low-cost [[Mac mini]].

[[Image:MacBook.jpg|right|thumb|The new [[MacBook Pro]] is Apple's first consumer laptop with an Intel microprocessor.]]

===2006 to present - Start of the Intel era===
{{main|Apple Intel transition}}
On [[January 10]], [[2006]], Apple released its first [[Intel]] chip computers, a new [[notebook computer]] known as the [[MacBook Pro]] (a 15.4 inch laptop which replaced the [[PowerBook]] G4 line and offers a 4X speed improvement) and a new (though identical) [[iMac]] with a 2-3 times faster performance increase. Both used Intel's [[Intel Core|Core Duo]] chip technology. 

The current operating system, OS X Tiger 10.4(.5), runs natively on the new Intel machines, as do many applications, such as iLife '06. Other applications, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]], compiled for the PowerPC, run in emulation mode, using a technology known as [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]. 

(see [[Apple Intel transition]] for more information regarding the transition)

The Intel-based machines do not support Classic (as it has not been translated to x86 binaries), so applications that run only in Mac OS 9 and earlier will not run on these machines. All Macintosh product lines are expected to transition to Intel processors by the end of 2006. The Apple online store sold out of 17-inch iMac G5 computers in [[February 2006]], and Apple ended the life of its 15 inch PowerBook G4 on Wednesday the 22nd of February 2006.

The Apple/Intel partnership has coined a new catch-phrase among computer users: &quot;Mactel&quot;, in response to the phrase &quot;[[Wintel]],&quot; an informal moniker that describes all Intel-powered systems running the Microsoft Windows operating system. This moniker has never been used seriously by Apple's PR or exceutives, mainly in use only in Apple fanatic circles.

===Hardware===
Apple introduced the [[Apple Macintosh]] family in 1984 and today makes consumer, professional, and educational computers. The [[Mac mini]] is the company's consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in January 2005 and designed to motivate [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users to switch to the Macintosh platform. The [[iMac]] is a consumer desktop computer that was first introduced by Apple in 1998, and its popularity helped save the company from bankruptcy. Now in its third design iteration, the iMac is similar in concept to the original Macintosh in that the monitor and computer are housed in a single unit. The [[Power Mac G5]], Apple's desktop computer for the professional and creative market, is a member of the [[Power Macintosh]] series first introduced in 1994. The [[eMac]] is Apple's cheaper alternative to the iMac for the education market. Apple's server range includes the [[Xserve]], a single-processor, dual-processor, and cluster-node server range, and the [[Xserve RAID]] for server storage options.

Apple introduced the [[iBook]] consumer portable computer as a companion to the iMac; it is Apple's lowest cost portable computer. The [[MacBook Pro]] is the professional portable computer alternative to the iBook intended for the professional and creative market and replaced the [[PowerBook]] range. PowerBooks are still being manufactured and sold, but is expected that Apple will phase out both the PowerBook and iBook lines upon arrival of the heavily rumoured MacBook, the low end version of the [[MacBook Pro]] and [[Intel]]-based version of the [[iBook]]. The Powerbook range was first introduced in 1991 and helped Apple's profits increase during the 1990s.

In 2001, Apple introduced the [[Apple iPod |iPod]] [[digital music player]] and currently sells the iPod (with video), available in 30 and 60 GB models; the [[iPod nano]], available in 1 GB, 2GB and 4 GB models; and the [[iPod shuffle]], available in 512 MB and 1 GB models. 

[[Image:MacminiWhiteBGSmall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mac mini]] is Apple's lowest cost desktop computer.]]
Apple sells a variety of computer accessories for Macintosh computers including the [[iSight]] video conferencing camera, the [[AirPort]] wirelss networking products; [[Apple Cinema Display|Apple Cinema HD Display]] and [[Apple Displays]] computer displays; [[Apple Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]] and [[Apple Wireless Mouse]] computer mice; the [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]] computer keyboard and the [[Apple USB Modem]].

===Software===
Apple independently develops [[computer software]] titles for its [[Mac OS X]] operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented [[iLife]] software package which bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie|iMovie HD]], [[iPhoto]], [[iTunes]], [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. Both [[iTunes]] and a feature-limited version of the [[QuickTime]] media player are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and Windows.  For presentation and page layout, [[iWork]] is available.

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the [[Mac OS X Server]] operating system; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote desktop control application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java]] [[World Wide Web|Web]] [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creatives market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video software package, as well as [[Final Cut Express HD]], a cut-down version, for [[Standard-definition television|SD]] and [[High-definition television|HD]] video editors; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit, and [[Logic Express]], its prosumer cousin; and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[.Mac]] which bundles [[Web page|.Mac HomePage]], [[E-mail|.Mac Mail]], .Mac Groups [[social network service]], [[iDisk|.Mac iDisk]], [[Backup (backup software)|.Mac Backup]], [[iSync|.Mac Sync]], and Learning Center online tutorials.

==Corporate affairs==
===Logo===
[[Image:Originalapplelogo.jpg|thumb|left|110px|The original Apple logo featuring [[Isaac Newton]] under the fabled apple tree.]]
[[Image:Striped apple logo.png|thumb|right|110px|The rainbow Apple logo, used from late 1976 to early 1998.]]
[[Image:Apple-logo.png|thumb|right|110px|The current Apple logo. On products, a simple gray version of the Apple is used, without embellishing it as has been done to computerized images.]]

The original Apple logo was designed by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Ron Wayne]] and depicts Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. However this design was soon to be replaced by the now famous [[rainbow]] apple with a &quot;bite&quot; taken out of it. It was one of a set of designs [[Rob Janoff]] presented Jobs in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;[http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,60597,00.html Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the book Zeroes and Ones, author [[Sadie Plant]] speculates that the rainbow Apple logo was a homage to [[Alan Turing]], the homosexual father of modern computer science who committed suicide by eating a cyanide-laced apple in imitation of the movie ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. This seems to be an [[urban legend]] as the Apple logo was designed two years before [[Gilbert Baker]]'s [[Rainbow flag|rainbow pride flag]], and did not follow the same color pattern.

In 1998, the logo became single-colored, though no specific color is prescribed; for example, it is grey on the [[Power Mac G5]] and [[iMac G5|Apple iMac]], blue (by default) in [[Mac OS X]], chrome on the 'About this Mac' panel and the boot screen in OS X 10.3 and 10.4, red on many [[Software]] packages, and white on the [[iBook]], [[PowerBook G4]] and [[MacBook Pro]]. The logo's shape is one of the most recognized brand symbols in the world, and is featured quite prominently on all Apple products and retail stores.

===Criticism===
Apple was criticized for its [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] business model, which runs against the  &quot;received wisdom&quot; of some economists, particularly those who study the computer industry. However, the company is profitable. Others criticize the company by suggesting it has been personality-driven, especially during the two eras of Steve Jobs' tenure. Some even regard the company as a cult or at least having cult-like features. Jobs' charisma, infamously referred to as his [[reality distortion field]], has drawn criticism. 

From a technical standpoint, Apple was also criticized for having a closed and proprietary architecture with the original Macintosh and refusing to adopt open standards; for many years a &quot;[[Not Invented Here]]&quot; (NIH) culture seemed to prevail. The [[ITunes Music Store|iTunes Music Store]] continues this trend, utilizing a proprietary [[Digital rights management|Digital Rights Management]] system called [[FairPlay]] that requires burning and re-ripping a CD to place purchased songs on any [[digital audio player]] besides the [[Apple iPod | iPod]].

That trend was largely reversed with [[Mac OS X]], and the company now has an official policy of adopting relevant open industry standards. Mac OS X is based on a [[free software]] / [[Open-source software|open source software]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and core operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. Apple also uses an open source framework called [[WebKit]] in its [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]]. 

Apple has used industry-standard hardware technologies for many years. Many Apple technologies have also become industry standards where no former standard existed, for example [[Zeroconf|Bonjour]] zero-configuration networking, and [[FireWire]]. Some non-Apple technologies only gained wide industry acceptance after Apple adopted them, including 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]]s, [[SCSI]], the [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB), [[Wi-Fi]] and, of course, graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Apple has recently adopted an Intel-based architecture. Apple's industry-standard software implementations include [[iCalendar]], as well as a host of other networking protocols.

[[Open-source software|Open source software]] advocates are often critical of Apple's attempt to appeal to their particular movements. Such advocates claim that such a marketing scheme is not taken seriously enough by Apple because Mac OS X has many proprietary technologies in essential areas. Other open source advocates make a counter-argument that Apple has done much more for open source software than many other major commercial software developers by releasing large portions of source code to the public through the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL). Some third-party developers are also critical of the competing factions within Apple itself, noting an apparent rivalry between the developers of [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], which came from NeXT, and those of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]], which came from Apple. This rivalry is seen as counterproductive and unnecessary by many developers.

Apple's retail initiative has had a mixed reception despite its success promoting the Apple brand. Retailers have suggested that Apple-owned retail stores receive preference when receiving Apple hardware, obtaining limited stock product earlier and at lower prices. This accusation is denied by Apple.

==User culture==
:''See Also: [[Cult of Mac]]''

Some Apple customers are devoted to their brand. Some refuse to buy from competitors and stridently uphold their belief in the perceived superiority of Apple products; according to surveys by [[J. D. Power]], Apple has the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer. While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. As [[Guy Kawasaki]] has said, &quot;[the brand fanaticism was] something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing] by Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba&lt;/ref&gt;

Macintosh users meet at the [[Apple Expo]] and [[MacWorld Expo]] trade shows where Apple introduces new products each year to the industry and public. Many users show their loyalty and devotion by wearing Apple [[t-shirt]]s. Another example of Apple's user culture is the [[Apple_Store_%28retail%29|Apple Store]] openings where many wait and sleep outside of stores for days prior to their openings.

[[John Sculley]], former Apple CEO, told the Guardian newspaper in 1997: &quot;''People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company, It was the marketing company of the decade.''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/0,56677-0.html Wired News: Apple: It's All About the Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable litigation==
{{main|Notable litigation of Apple Computer}}
Apple's earliest court action dates to 1978 when [[Apple Records|Apple Corps]], [[The Beatles]]-founded record label, filed suit against Apple Computer for trademark infringement. The suit settled in 1981 with an amount of $80,000 being paid to Apple Corps. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. The case arose in 1989 again when Apple Corps sued, claiming violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement of around $26.5 million was reached. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Apple+vs.+Apple+Perfect+harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html news.com: Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony?]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003 Apple Computer was sued by Apple Corps again, this time for introducing [[iTunes]] and the [[Apple iPod | iPod]] which Apple Corps believed was a violation of the previous agreement by Apple not to distribute music. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalzoom.com/articles/article_content/article11325.html legalzoom.com: Apple v Apple: What is at the core of The Beatles’ Apple Records vs. Apple Ipod…]&lt;/ref&gt; The date for this trial has been set for [[March 27]], [[2006]] in the UK. At the present time [[the Beatles]]' songs are not available for download from any legal music download sites, including the [[iTunes Music Store]].

In 1982 Apple filed a lawsuit against [[Franklin Computer Corp.]], alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of Apple's [[operating system]] and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. [[Apple v. Franklin]] established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software. As a result, Apple began embedding an encrypted image in ROM. This icon displays &quot;Stolen from Apple Computer&quot;.

In 1988 Apple sued Microsoft and [[Hewlett-Packard]] on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyright on a GUI. The [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]] trial lasted for four years. The ruling was decided against Apple, and the concept of a GUI was no longer the domain of Apple alone.

In July 1998 [[Abdul Traya]] registered the domain name ''appleimac.com'', two months after Apple announced the [[iMac]], in an attempt to draw attention to a web-hosting business. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1023-221921.html news.com: Teen in dispute with Apple over domain]&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal dispute that lasted until April 1999, Traya and Apple settled out of court with Apple paying legal fees and giving Traya a &quot;''token payment''&quot; in exchange for the domain name. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macobserver.com/news/99/april/990427/applevsteen.html macobserver.com:  Battle For Domain Name Between Apple And Teen Resolved]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Apple was sued by the astronomer and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] for using his name as the internal code-name for the [[Power Macintosh 7100]]. Sagan lost the suit twice. See the Carl Sagan [[Carl Sagan#Personality|article]] for details.

In November 2000, [[Benjamin Cohen]] of [http://www.cyberbritain.co.uk CyberBritain] registered the domain name &quot;itunes.co.uk&quot; for an MP3 search engine. Apple was granted a UK restricted (non music) trademark for ITUNES on [[March 23]], [[2001]], and launched its popular iTunes music store service in the UK in 2004. In 2005, Apple took the matter to the Dispute Resolution Service operated by [[.uk]] [[domain|domain name]] [[registry]] [[Nominet UK]], stating that they had rights in the name &quot;iTunes&quot;. An expert decided in Apple's favor in the dispute. Cohen launched a media offensive stating that the DRS was biased towards large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet.

In November 2004, two popular [[weblog]] sites that feature [[Mac rumors community|Apple rumors]] publicly revealed information about an unreleased Apple product code-named &quot;Asteroid&quot;, also known as &quot;Project Q97&quot;. The sites, &quot;AppleInsider&quot; and &quot;PowerPage&quot;, were subpoenaed for information about their sources in the [[Apple v. Does]] case. In February 2005 it was decided by a court official in California that the bloggers do not have the same [[shield law]] protection as do journalists. In a related case, the websites went on to fight the journalistic status decision. In a separate matter, Apple filed a lawsuit against website [[Think Secret]] in January 2005, claiming that the site's reports about forthcoming Apple products violated trade secret law.

In May 2005 Apple entered into a [[class action]] settlement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleipodsettlement.com http://www.appleipodsettlement.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld on December 20, 2005 following an appeal, regarding the battery life of [[Apple iPod | iPod]] music players sold prior to May 2004.  Eligible members of the class are entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement.

'''Aberdeenshire''' (''Siorrachd Obar Dheathain'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is one of the 32 [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[council areas]] in [[Scotland]].

Present day Aberdeenshire does not include the [[City of Aberdeen]] which is a unitary authority in its own right. However Aberdeenshire council has its headquarters at Woodhill House, Westburn Road, in  [[Aberdeen]] - The only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outside of the council area. It also borders [[Angus]], [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Highland]], and [[Moray]]. 

==History==
The present council area is named after the historic [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeenshire]] which had different boundaries and was abolished in [[1975]]. Between 1975 and 1996 the area became part of the [[Regions of Scotland|region]] of [[Grampian]]. When the Scottish regions were abolished, a new unitary council area of Aberdeenshire was created, which revived the name of the former county but with different boundaries.

==Aberdeenshire council==
Aberdeenshire Council was established in April [[1996]], replacing three [[District council]]s ([[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]] and [[Kincardine and Deeside]]) and part of the area of [[Grampian Region]]al Council.

There are 68 [[councillor]]s; in 2004 they were 28 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]], 15 [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], 14 Independent and 11 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].

The Council's net expenditure is £399.1m a year (2003/04).

Education takes the largest share of expenditure (55%), followed by Social Work and Housing (19%), Transportation and Infrastructure (11%), and Joint Services such as Fire and Police (10%). 22% of revenue is raised locally through the Council Tax. Average Band D [[Council Tax]] is the eighth lowest in mainland Scotland at £966 (2003/04).

The council area has a population of 226,871, representing 4.5% of Scotland's total, and a 20% increase since 1981, 50% since 1971. Major towns are Peterhead (17,947), Fraserburgh (12,454), Inverurie (10,882), Stonehaven (9,577), Westhill (9,498) and Ellon (8,754). The population has a higher proportion of younger age groups than the rest of Scotland, reflecting employment-driven in-migration in recent decades.

The council has devolved power to six [[area committee]]s:
*[[Banff &amp; Buchan]],
*[[Buchan]],
*[[Formartine]],
*[[Garioch]],
*[[Marr]],
*[[Kincardine &amp; Mearns]]

;'''Banff &amp; Buchan'''
Population 35,742 (2001 Census)

Fishing and agriculture are important industries, together with associated processing and service activity.

The area is relatively self-contained, and in recent years has seen a small decline in population. It does, however, have tourism assets in its coastline, coastal villages and [[visitor attraction]]s. Economic dependency, peripherality, and the future of the Common Fisheries/Agricultural Policies, are key issues. The Buchan Local Action Plan will address some of these concerns. The Area qualifies for [[European Union Objective 2]] structural funding.

;'''Buchan'''
Population 39,160 (2001 Census)

[[Peterhead]] is the largest town in Aberdeenshire; the principal white fish landing port in Europe; and a major oil industry service centre. Equally important, is the nearby gas terminal at [[St Fergus]].

Attempts are being made to counter the negative effects of several recent key company closures and economic threats. Inland, the area is dependent upon agriculture, and many villages have seen a decline in population and services. Issues affecting Banff and Buchan also apply here, as does the future of the oil and gas industry. Part of Buchan benefits from EU aid coverage. Opportunities exist through the Buchan Local Action Plan to safeguard and enhance the economic future of Peterhead and Buchan.

;'''Formartine'''
Population 36,478 (2001 Census)

Formartine has experienced rapid population growth, particularly around [[Ellon]] and [[Oldmeldrum]], and in the south east where development has spread outwith the city of Aberdeen. By contrast, the area around [[Turriff]] retains strong dependency on the traditional agricultural economy. The area's coastline and rural environment offer recreation potential.

;'''Garioch'''
Population 42,947 (2001 Census)

Centred on [[Inverurie]], a traditional rural market town, Garioch has also experienced rapid growth due to its proximity to the city of Aberdeen. Significant growth in population, services and employment is anticipated in the [[A96 road|A96]] corridor and in [[Westhill]]. The area is largely agricultural, but is strongly affected by the City's economy and the oil and gas sector. Garioch holds growing potential for tourism, in its environment and archaeological heritage.

;'''Marr'''
Population 34,038 (2001 Census)

To the west, the mountain environment of the [[Cairngorms]] [[National Park]] sustains a well developed tourist industry based on heritage and outdoor pursuits. Forestry and livestock farming are key industries, particularly in remoter areas. Part of the area has qualified for EU financial assistance. To the east, Marr has experienced population growth due to its strong commuter links with the city of Aberdeen.

;'''Kincardine and Mearns'''
Population 38,506 (2001 Census)

Transport links with Aberdeen have encouraged very rapid population growth, especially to the north of the area. Existing settlements such as [[Portlethen]] and [[Stonehaven]] have greatly expanded, along with industrial activity. The southern part is more self-contained, with the fertile Mearns area sustaining a strong agricultural economy. Small scale tourism activity exists along its attractive coastline and former fishing villages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aztlan Underground''' is a fusion band from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Since the early 1990s, Aztlan Underground has played [[Rapcore]]. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.

This unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.

The artists are Chenek &quot;DJ Bean&quot; (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe &quot;Peps&quot; (bass, rattles), Zo Rock (Guitars), Ace (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).

Aztlan Underground appeared on television on [[Culture Clash]] on Fox in [[1993]], was part of ''Breaking Out'', a concert on pay per view in [[1998]], and was featured in the independent films ''Algun Dia'' and ''Frontierlandia''.

The band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the [[Vancouver Sun]], [[Northshore News]] (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), [[New Times]] (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), [[BAM Magazine]] (Southern California), [[La Banda Elastica Magazine]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar section. It is also the subject of a chapter in ''It's Not About A Salary'', by Brian Cross.

It was nominated in the New Times 1998 &quot;Best Latin Influenced&quot; category, the BAM Magazine 1999 &quot;Best Rock en Español&quot; category, and the [[LA Weekly]] 1999 &quot;Best Hip Hop&quot; category.

[[Image:1anschluss.gif|thumb|right|250px|German troops march into [[Austria]] on [[12 March]] [[1938]].]]
The '''Anschluss'''{{ref|spelling}} ([[German language|German]]: ''connection'', or ''political union''), also known as the '''Anschluss Österreichs''', was the 1938 inclusion of [[Austria]] into &quot;[[Großdeutschland|Greater Germany]]&quot; by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]].

The events of [[March 12]], [[1938]], were the first major steps in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s long-desired expansion of [[Germany]]. The Anschluss followed the return to Germany of the [[Saarland#History|Saar]] region, which had been under the control of the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was followed by the inclusion of the [[Sudetenland]] later in 1938, the invasion of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, and the [[Polish September Campaign|invasion of Poland]].

The Anschluss was preceded by a period of growing political pressure on [[Austria]], exerted by Germany, demanding recognition of the outlawed Austrian National-Socialist party and later, their share of Government.  In 1938 Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], in a last bid to retain Austrian independence, announced a referendum to determine independence or union with Germany. Germany then pressured Schuschnigg into handing over power to the Nazi party. This well-planned [[Coup d'état|internal overthrow]] by the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi Party]] of Austria's state institutions in [[Vienna]] on [[March 11]] meant that when [[Wehrmacht]] troops entered into Austria to enforce the Anschluss, no fighting ever took place. The international response to the Anschluss was mild: The [[World War I]] [[Allies]] only lodged diplomatic protests, and no concrete action was taken to reverse the Anschluss, even though the allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. Austria ceased to exist as an independent nation until a preliminary Austrian government was finally reinstated on [[April 27]], [[1945]], and was legally recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the following months.

:''Main articles: [[German Empire]] and [[Austrofascism]]''

The idea of grouping all German people into one state had been the subject of inconclusive debate since the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806. Prior to 1866, it was generally thought that the unification of the German peoples could only succeed under Austrian leadership (''[[Grossdeutschland]]''), but the loss of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] by Austria allowed [[Otto von Bismarck]] to establish the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]] in 1871 without the German-speaking parts of [[Austria-Hungary]] (''[[Kleindeutschland]]''). When the latter broke up in 1918, many German-speaking Austrians hoped to join with Germany in the realignment of Europe, but the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 explicitly vetoed the inclusion of Austria within a German state, because [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] feared the power of a larger Germany.

In the early 1930s, popular support for union with Germany remained overwhelming, and the Austrian government looked to a possible [[customs union]] with Germany in 1931. However Hitler's and the [[Nazi]]s' rise to power in Germany left the Austrian government with little enthusiasm for such formal ties. Hitler, born in Austria, had promoted an &quot;all-German Reich&quot; from the early beginnings of his leadership in the [[NSDAP]] and had publicly stated as early as 1924 in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' that he would attempt a union, by force if necessary.

[[Austria]] shared the economic turbulence of post-1929 Europe with a high unemployment rate and unstable commerce and industry. Similar to its northern and southern neighbours these uncertain conditions made the young democracy very vulnerable. The [[First Republic]], dominated from the late 1920s by the Catholic nationalist [[Christian Social Party]] (CS), gradually disintegrated from 1933 (dissolution of parliament and ban of the Austrian National Socialists) to 1934 ([[Austrian Civil War]] in February and ban of all remaining parties except the CS) and evolved into a pseudo-[[fascist]], [[corporatist]] model of one-party government which combined the CS and the paramilitary [[Heimwehr]] with absolute state domination of [[labour relations]] and no [[freedom of the press]] (see [[Austrofascism]] and [[Patriotic Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]]). Power was centralized in the office of the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] who was empowered to [[rule by decree]]. The predominance of the Christian Social Party (whose economic policies were based on the [[pope|papal]] [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'') was an Austrian phenomenon in that Austria's national identity had strong Catholic elements which were incorporated into the movement by way of clerical authoritarian tendencies which are certainly not to be found in Nazism. Both [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and his successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] turned to Austria's other fascist neighbour, [[Italy]], for inspiration and support. Indeed, the statist corporatism often referred to as Austrofascism bore more resemblance to [[Fascism|Italian Fascism]] than German National Socialism. [[Benito Mussolini]] was able to support the independent aspirations of the Austrian dictatorship until his need for German support in [[Ethiopia]] forced him into a client relationship with Berlin that began with the 1937 [[Axis Powers|Berlin-Rome Axis]].

When Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the illegal [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazi party]] on [[25 July]] [[1934]] in a failed coup, the second civil war within only one year followed, lasting until August 1934. After the failed Nazi coup, many leading Austrian Nazis fled to [[Germany]] and continued to coordinate their steps from there while the remaining Austrian Nazis started to make use of terrorist attacks against the Austrian governmental institutions (causing a death toll of more than 800 between 1934 and 1938). Dollfuss' successor Schuschnigg, who followed the political course of Dollfuss, took drastic actions against the Nazis, for instance the rounding up of Nazis (but also Social Democrats) in [[internment camps]].

==The Anschluss of 1938==
===Hitler's first moves===
[[Image:1ajansa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alfred Jansa was forced to retire as Chief of Staff in January 1938]]

In early 1938 Hitler had consolidated his power in Germany and was ready to reach out to fulfil his long-planned expansion. After a lengthy period of pressure by Germany, Hitler met Schuschnigg on [[12 February]] [[1938]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] ([[Bavaria]]) and instructed him to lift the ban of the Austrian Nazi party, reinstate full party freedoms, release all imprisoned members of the [[Nazi]] party and let them participate in the government. Otherwise he would take military action. Schuschnigg complied with Hitler's demands and appointed [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], a Nazi lawyer, as [[Interior Minister]] and another Nazi, [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau]], as Minister without Portfolio.{{ref|encarta}}

Even before the February meeting, Schuschnigg was under considerable pressure from Germany. This may be seen in the demand to remove the chief of staff of the [[Austrian Army]] [[Alfred Jansa]] from his office in January 1938. Jansa and his staff had developed a scenario for Austria's defence against a German attack, a situation Hitler wanted to avoid at all costs. Schuschnigg subsequently complied with the demand.{{ref|wienerzeitung}}

During the following weeks Schuschnigg realized that his newly appointed ministers were gradually working on taking over his authority. Schuschnigg tried to gather support throughout Austria and inflame [[patriotism]] among the people. For the first time since [[12 February]] [[1934]] (the time of the [[Austrian Civil War]]), socialists and communists could legally appear in public again. The [[communists]] announced their unconditional support for the Austrian government, understandable in light of Nazi pressure on Austria. The [[socialists]] demanded further concessions from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him.

===Schuschnigg announces a referendum===
On [[9 March]], as a last resort to preserve Austria's independence, Schuschnigg scheduled a [[plebiscite]] on the [[independence]] of Austria for [[13 March]]. To secure a large majority in the referendum, Schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at 24 in order to exclude younger voters who largely sympathized with Nazi ideology. Holding a referendum was a highly risky gamble for Schuschnigg, and on the next day it became apparent that Hitler would not simply stand by while Austria declared its independence by public vote. Hitler declared that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it. In addition the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order. Schuschnigg immediately publicly replied that the reports of riots were nothing but lies—as they actually were.

Hitler sent an [[ultimatum]] to [[Schuschnigg]] on [[11 March]], demanding that he hand over all power to the [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian National Socialists]] or face an invasion. The ultimatum was set to expire at noon, but was extended by two hours. However, without waiting for an answer, Hitler had already signed the order to send troops into Austria at one o'clock, issuing it to [[Hermann Göring]] only hours later.

Schuschnigg desperately sought support for Austrian independence in the hours following the [[ultimatum]], but, realizing that neither [[France]] nor the [[United Kingdom]] were willing to take steps, he resigned as Chancellor that evening. In the radio broadcast in which he announced his [[resignation]], he argued that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government in order to avoid bloodshed. Meanwhile, Austrian President [[Wilhelm Miklas]] refused to appoint [[Artur Seyss-Inquart|Seyss-Inquart]] Chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians such as Michael Skubl and Sigismund Schilhawsky to assume the office. However, the Nazis were well organised. Within hours they managed to take control of many parts of Vienna, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs (controlling the Police). As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government and Seyss-Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government demanding German troops to restore order, Hitler became furious. At about 10 pm, well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion, Göring and Hitler gave up on waiting and published a forged telegram containing a request by the Austrian Government for German troops to enter Austria. Around midnight, after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested, Miklas finally conceded to appoint Seyss-Inquart Chancellor.{{ref|wienerzeitung_a}}

===German troops march into Austria===
&lt;!-- [[Image:Stimzettel-Anschluss.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Voting ballot from [[10 April]] [[1938]]. The ballot text reads &quot;Do you agree with the reunification of Austria with the German Empire that was enacted on [[13 March]] [[1938]], and do you vote for the party of our leader Adolf Hitler?,&quot; the large circle is labelled &quot;Yes,&quot; the smaller &quot;No.&quot;]] --&gt;
[[Image:Voting-booth-Anschluss-10-April-1938.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Propaganda even in the voting booth on [[10 April]] [[1938]], with a poster instructing voters how to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.]]

On the morning of [[12 March]] the 8th Army of the German [[Wehrmacht]] crossed the German-Austrian border. They did not face resistance by the [[Austrian Army]] — on the contrary, the German troops were greeted by cheering Austrians. Although the invading forces were badly organized and coordination between the units was poor, it mattered little because no fighting took place. It did, however, serve as a warning for commanders in future German military operations such as that against [[Czechoslovakia]]. Curiously, the invasion claimed its first fatality within only a few hours: the Nazi [[Heinrich Kurz von Goldstein]] died of a heart attack during the celebrations in [[Salzburg]].

Hitler's car crossed the border in the afternoon at [[Braunau]], his birthplace. In the evening, he arrived at [[Linz]] and was given an enthusiastic welcome in the city hall. The atmosphere was so intense that Göring in a telephone call that evening stated: &quot;There is unbelievable jubilation in Austria. We ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense.&quot;

Hitler's further travel through Austria changed into a triumphal tour that climaxed in [[Vienna]], when around 200,000 Austrians gathered on the [[Heldenplatz]] (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss ([http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.film.data.film/f107a.mpg Video: Hitler proclaims Austria's inclusion in the Reich (2MB)]). Hitler later commented: &quot;Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.&quot;{{ref|hitlerspeech}}

The Anschluss was given immediate effect by legislative act on [[13 March]], subject to ratification by a plebiscite. Austria became the [[province]] of [[Ostmark]], and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Governor. The plebiscite was held on [[10 April]] and officially recorded a support of 99.73 % of the voters.{{ref|doew}}
While historians concur that the result itself was not manipulated, the voting process was not free or secret. Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand (in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box). In addition, Hitler's brutal methods to emasculate any opposition had been immediately implemented in the weeks preceding the referendum. Even before the first German soldier crossed the border, [[Heinrich Himmler]] and a few [[SS]] officers landed in Vienna to arrest prominent representatives of the First Republic such as [[Richard Schmitz]], [[Leopold Figl]], [[Friedrich Hillegeist]] and [[Franz Olah]]. During the weeks following the Anschluss (and before the plebiscite), Social Democrats, Communists, and other potential political dissenters, as well as Jews, were rounded up and either imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. Within only a few days of [[12 March]], 70,000 people had been arrested. The [[referendum]] itself was subject to large-scale [[propaganda]] and to the abrogation of the voting rights of around 400,000 people (nearly 10 % of the eligible voting population), mainly former members of left-wing parties and Jews.{{ref|doew_a}}
Interestingly, in some remote areas of Austria the referendum on the independence of Austria on [[13 March]] was held despite the [[Wehrmacht]]'s presence in Austria (it took up to 3 days to occupy every part of Austria). For instance, in the village of [[Innervillgraten]] a majority of 95 % voted for Austria's independence.{{ref|wienerzeitung_b}}

Austria remained part of the [[Third Reich]] until the end of [[World War II]] when a preliminary Austrian Government declared the Anschluss void and null on [[April 27]] [[1945]]. After the war then [[allied]] occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country, but was not restored to [[sovereignty]] until the [[Austrian State Treaty]] and Austrian [[Declaration of Neutrality]], both of 1955, largely due to the rapid development of the [[Cold War]] and disputes between the [[Soviet Union]] and its former allies over its foreign policy.

==Reactions and consequences of the Anschluss==
[[Image:karl-renner.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|Social Democrat Karl Renner publicly announced his support for the Anschluss]]

The picture of Austria in the first days of its existence in the [[Third Reich]] is one of contradictions: At one and the same time, Hitler's terror regime began to tighten its grip in every area of society, beginning with mass arrests and thousands of Austrians attempting to flee in every direction; yet Austrians could be seen cheering and welcoming German troops entering Austrian territory. Many Austrian political figures did not hesitate to announce their support of the Anschluss and their relief that it happened without violence.

Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] (a political figure of the CS) declared as early as [[12 March]]: &quot;The Viennese Catholics should thank the Lord for the bloodless way this great political change has occurred, and they should pray for a great future for Austria. Needless to say, everyone should obey the orders of the new institutions.&quot; The other Austrian bishops followed suit some days later. [[Vatican Radio]], however, immediately broadcast a vehement denunciation of the German action, and Cardinal [[Pius XII|Pacelli]] ordered Innitzer to report to Rome. Before meeting with the pope, Innitzer met with Pacelli, who had been outraged by Innitzer's statement. He made it clear that Innitzer needed to retract; he was made to sign a new statement, issued on behalf of all the Austrian bishops, which provided: ''“The solemn declaration of the Austrian bishops ... was clearly not intended to be an approval of something that was not and is not compatible with God's law”''. The Vatican newspaper also reported that the bishops' earlier statement had been issued without the approval from Rome.

Robert Kauer, President of the [[Protestants]] in Austria, greeted Hitler on [[13 March]] as &quot;saviour of the 350,000 German Protestants in Austria and liberator from a five-year hardship.&quot; Even [[Karl Renner]], the most famous Social Democrat of the First Republic announced his support for the Anschluss and appealed to all Austrians to vote in favour of it on [[10 April]].{{ref|wienerzeitung_c}}

The international response to the expansion of Germany may be described as ''moderate''. ''[[The Times]]'' commented that 200 years ago Scotland had joined England as well and that this event would not really differ much. On [[14 March]] the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] noted in the [[House of Commons]]:

[[Image:Neville Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|British [[appeasement]] policy led to the [[Treaty of Munich]], the next major step for [[Hitler]] to create an all-German Reich]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Majesty's Government have throughout been in the closest touch with the situation. The Foreign Secretary saw the German Foreign Minister on the 10th&amp;nbsp;of March and addressed to him a grave warning on the Austrian situation and upon what appeared to be the policy of the German Government in regard to it. . . . Late on the 11th&amp;nbsp;of March our Ambassador in Berlin registered a protest in strong terms with the German Government against such use of coercion, backed by force, against an independent State in order to create a situation incompatible with its national independence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However the speech concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I imagine that according to the temperament of the individual the events which are in our minds to-day will be the cause of regret, of sorrow, perhaps of indignation. They cannot be regarded by His Majesty's Government with indifference or equanimity. They are bound to have effects which cannot yet be measured. The immediate result must be to intensify the sense of uncertainty and insecurity in Europe. Unfortunately, while the policy of appeasement would lead to a relaxation of the economic pressure under which many countries are suffering to-day, what has just occurred must inevitably retard economic recovery and, indeed, increased care will be required to ensure that marked deterioration does not set in. This is not a moment for hasty decisions or for careless words. We must consider the new situation quickly, but with cool judgement... As regards our defence programmes, we have always made it clear that they were flexible and that they would have to be reviewed from time to time in the light of any development in the international situation. It would be idle to pretend that recent events do not constitute a change of the kind that we had in mind. Accordingly we have decided to make a fresh review, and in due course we shall announce what further steps we may think it necessary to take. {{ref|speech}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lenient reaction to the Anschluss was the first major consequence of the strictly followed [[appeasement]] British foreign policy strategy. The international reaction on the events of [[March 12]]th 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his ''roadmap'' to expand the [[Third Reich]], as he would later in annexing the [[Sudetenland]]. The relatively bloodless Anschluss helped pave the way for the [[Treaty of Munich]] in September 1938 and the annexation of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, because it reinforced [[appeasement]] as the right way for Britain to deal with Hitler's [[Germany]].

==Legacy of the 1938 Anschluss==
===The Anschluss: annexation or union?===
Some historical sources, for instance [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and the [[Encarta|Encarta Encyclopedia]] describe the Anschluss as an &quot;annexation&quot; {{ref|encarta_sidebar}}. Outside this context &quot;Anschluss&quot; is properly translated as &quot;join&quot;, &quot;connection&quot;, &quot;[[unification]]&quot; or &quot;political union&quot;. The German word &quot;Annektierung&quot; would mean military annexation unambiguously. However, the word commonly used in German for the process of spring 1938 is ''Anschluss''.

The precise character of the Anschluss remains a difficulty essential to Austria's understanding of its history and the obligations it entails.

===The appeal of Nazism to Austrians===
The Anschluss can be misunderstood as ''simply'' a military annexation of an unwilling Austria, but this lends itself to confusion with other German military occupations of European countries. It also tends to conceal the culpability of many Austrians in Nazi crimes, most of all the [[Holocaust]], by perpetuating the myth of Austria as the first victim of Hitler's expansionism. Despite the subversion of Austrian political process by Hitler's sympathisers and associates in Austria, Austrian acceptance of direct government by Hitler's Berlin is a very different phenomenon from the administration of other collaborationist countries.

With the break-up of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] in 1918, popular opinion was for unification with Germany, in realization of the [[Grossdeutschland]] concept- this however was forbidden by the [[Treaty of St. Germain]], to which the newly formed Austrian republic was obliged. This was in stark contrast to the general concept of [[self-determination]] which governed the  [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles talks]], as was the inclusion of the [[Sudetenland]], a German-populated area of the former Austro-Hungarian province of [[Bohemia]] (whose population favoured joining German-speaking Austria), in the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] republic, giving rise to [[revisionism|revisionist]] sentiment. This laid the grounds for the general willingness of the populations of both Austria and the Sudetenland for inclusion into the [[Third Reich]], as well as the relative acceptance of the Western Governments, who made little protest until March 1939, when the [[irredentism|irredentist]] argument lost its value following the annexation of the rest of Czech-speaking Bohemia, as well as Moravia and Czech Silesia.
[[Image:Grossdeutschland.jpg|thumb|right|Nazi propaganda poster]]

The small Republic of Austria was seen by many of its citizens as economically unviable, a feeling that was exacerbated by the [[Great Depression|Depression]] of the 1930s. In contrast the Nazi dictatorship appeared to have found a solution to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Furthermore, the break-up had thrown Austria into a crisis of identity, and many Austrians, of both the left and the right, felt that Austria should be part of a larger German nation. 

Politically, Austria had not had the time to develop a strongly democratic society to resist the onslaught of [[totalitarianism]]. The final version of the First Republic's constitution had only lasted from 1929 to 1933. The [[First Republic]] was ridden by violent strife between the different political camps; the [[Christian Social Party]] were complicit in the murder of large numbers of adherents of the decidedly left-wing [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] by the police during the [[July Revolt of 1927]]. In fact, with the end of democracy in 1933 and the establishment of [[Austrofascism]], Austria had already purged its democratic institutions and instituted a dictatorship long before the Anschluss. There is thus little to distinguish radically the ''institutions'' of at least the post-1934 Austrian government before or after [[12 March]] [[1938]].

The members of the leading [[Christian Social Party]] were fervent Catholics, but not particularly [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]]. For instance [[Jew|Jews]] were not prohibited from exercising any profession, in sharp contrast to the [[Third Reich]]. Many prominent Austrian scientists, professors, and lawyers at the time were Jewish; in fact [[Vienna]], with its Jewish population of about 200,000, was considered a [[safe haven]] from 1933 to 1938 by many Jews who fled Nazi Germany. However, the Nazis' anti-Semitism found fertile soil in Austria. Anti-Semitic elements had emerged as a force in Austrian politics in the late nineteenth century, with the rise in prominence of figures such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] and [[Karl Lueger]] (who had influenced the young Hitler), and in the 1930s anti-Semitism was rampant, as Jews were a convenient scapegoat for economic problems.

In addition to the economic appeal of the Anschluss, the popular underpinning of Nazi politics as a total art form (the refinement of film propaganda exemplified by [[Leni Riefenstahl|Riefenstahl's]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and mythological [[aestheticism]] of a broadly conceived national destiny of the [[German people]] within a &quot;Thousand-Year Reich&quot;) gave the Nazis a massive advantage in advancing their claims to power. Moreover [[Austrofascism]] was less grand in its appeal than the choice between [[Stalin]] and [[Hitler]] to which many European intellectuals of the time believed themselves reduced by the end of the decade. Austria had effectively no alternative view of its historical mission when the choice was upon it. In spite of Dollfuss' and Schuschnigg's hostility to Nazi political ambitions, the Nazis succeeded in convincing many Austrians to accept what they viewed as the historical destiny of the German people rather than continue as part of a distinct sovereign nation.

===The Second Republic===
====The Moscow Declaration====
[[Image:Seyss-inquartmugshot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] [[1945]] mugshot for the [[Nuremberg Trials]].]]

The [[Moscow Declaration]] of 1943, signed by the [[United States of America]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], and the [[United Kingdom]] included a &quot;Declaration on Austria,&quot; which stated the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States of America are agreed that Austria, the first free country to fall a victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They regard the annexation imposed on Austria by Germany on [[15 March]] [[1938]], as null and void. They consider themselves as in no way bound by any charges affected in Austria since that date. They declare that they wish to see re-established a free and independent Austria and thereby to open the way for the Austrian people themselves, as well as those neighbouring States which will be face with similar problems, to find that political and economic security which is the only basis for lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austria is reminded, however that she has a responsibility, which she cannot evade, for participation in the war at the side of Hitlerite Germany, and that in the final settlement account will inevitably be taken of her own contribution to her liberation. {{ref|moskauermemo}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To judge from the last paragraph and subsequent determinations at the [[Nuremberg Trial]], the Declaration was intended to serve as [[propaganda]] aimed at stirring Austrian resistance (although there are Austrians counted as [[Righteous Among the Nations]], there never was an effective Austrian armed resistance of the sort found in other countries under German occupation) more than anything else, although the exact text of the declaration is said to have a somewhat complex drafting history.{{ref|nybooks}} At Nuremberg [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] {{ref|seyss-inquart}} and [[Franz von Papen]] {{ref|vonpapen}}, in particular, were both indicted under count one (conspiracy to commit crimes against peace) specifically for their activities in support of the Austrian Nazi Party and the Anschluss, but neither was convicted of this count. In acquitting von Papen, the court noted that his actions were in its view political immoralities but not crimes under its charter. Seyss-Inquart was convicted of other serious war crimes, most of which took place in [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]], and was sentenced to death.

====Austrian identity and the &quot;victim theory&quot;====
[[Image:1heldeplatz.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heldenplatz, &quot;Day of the Austrian legion,&quot; [[2 April]] [[1938]].]]

After [[World War II]], many Austrians sought comfort in the myth of Austria as the Nazis' first victim. Although the Nazi party was promptly banned, Austria did not have the same thorough process of de-Nazification at the top of government which was imposed on Germany for a time. Lacking outside pressure for political reform, factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that the Anschluss was ''only'' an annexation at bayonet point.

This view of the events of 1938 has deep roots in the ten years of Allied occupation and the struggle to regain Austrian sovereignty: The ''victim theory'' played an essential role in the negotiations on the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Soviets, and by pointing to the Moscow Declaration Austrian politicians heavily relied on it to achieve a solution for Austria different from the division into East and West in Germany. The State Treaty, alongside with the subsequent Austrian declaration of permanent [[Neutral country|neutrality]] marked important milestones for the solidification of Austria's independent [[nation]]al identity during the following decades.

As Austrian politicians of the left and right attempted to reconcile their differences in order to avoid the violent conflict that had dominated the first republic, discussions of both Austrofascism and Austria's role in Nazism were largely avoided. Still, the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) has advanced and still sometimes advances the argument that the establishment of the Dollfuss dictatorship was necessary in order to maintain Austrian independence, while the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) argues that the dictatorship stripped the country of the democratic resources necessary to repel Hitler.

====Political events====
For decades, the victim theory established in the Austrian mind remained largely undisputed. The Austrian public was only rarely forced to confront the legacy of the Third Reich (most notably during the events of 1965 concerning [[Taras Borodajkewycz]], a professor of economic history notorious for anti-Semitic remarks, when [[Ernst Kirchweger]], a concentration camp survivor, was killed by a right-wing protester during riots). It was not until the 1980s that Austrians were finally massively confronted with their past. The main catalyst for the start of a ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]'' was the so-called [[Kurt Waldheim|Waldheim affair]]. The Austrian reply to allegations during the 1986 Presidential election campaign that successful candidate and former [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]] had been a member of the Nazi party and of the infamous [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (he was later absolved of direct involvement in [[war crimes]]) was that scrutiny was an unwelcome intervention in the country's [[internal affairs]]. Despite the politicians' reactions to international criticism of Waldheim, the Waldheim affair started the first serious major discussion on Austria's past and the Anschluss.

Another main factor for Austria and its coming to terms with the past emerged in the 1980s: [[Jörg Haider]] and the rise of the [[FPÖ]]. The party had combined elements of the [[pan-German]] right with free-market liberalism since its foundation in 1955, but after Haider had ascended to the party chairmanship in 1986, the liberal elements became increasingly marginalized while Haider began to openly use nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. He was often criticised for tactics such as the ''völkisch'' (ethnic) definition of national interest (&quot;Austria for Austrians&quot;) and his apologism for Austria's past, notably calling members of the [[Waffen-SS]] &quot;men of honour&quot;. Following an enormous electoral rise in the 1990s peaking in the [[Austria legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]], the FPÖ, now purged of its liberal elements, entered a coalition with the [[ÖVP]] led by [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] that met international condemnation in 2000. This coalition triggered the regular ''Donnerstagsdemonstrationen'' (Thursday demonstrations) in protest against the government, which took place on the [[Heldenplatz]], where Hitler had greeted the masses during the Anschluss. Haider's tactics and rhetoric, which were often criticised as sympathetic to Nazism, again forced Austrians to reconsider their relationship to the past.

But it is not [[Jörg Haider]] alone who has made questionable remarks on Austria's past: [[Jörg Haider]]'s coalition partner the current Chancellor [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] in an interview with the [[Jerusalem Post]] as late as 2000 stated that Austria was the first victim of Hitler-Germany.{{ref|jerusalem}}

====Literature====
Tearing into the simplism of the ''victim theory'' and the time of the [[Austrofascism]], [[Thomas Bernhard|Thomas Bernhard's]] last play, ''Heldenplatz'', was highly controversial even before it appeared on stage in 1988, fifty years after Hitler's visit. Bernhard's achievement was to make the elimination of references to Hitler's reception in Vienna emblematic of Austrian attempts to claim their history and culture under questionable criteria. Many politicians from all political factions called Bernhard a ''Nestbeschmutzer'' (so. damaging the reputation of his country) and openly demanded that the play should not be staged in Vienna's [[Burgtheater]]. [[Kurt Waldheim]], who was at that time still Austrian president called the play ''a crude insult to the Austrian people''.{{ref|bernhard}}

===The Historical Commission and outstanding legal issues===
In the context of the postwar [[Federal Republic of Germany]], one encounters a ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]'' (&quot;struggle to come to terms with the past&quot;) that has been partially institutionalised, variably in literary, cultural, political, and educational contexts (its development and difficulties have not been trivial; see, for example, the [[Historikerstreit]]). Austria formed a ''Historikerkommission''{{ref|historikerkommission}} (&quot;Historian's Commission&quot; or &quot;Historical Commission&quot;) in 1998 with a mandate to review Austria's role in the Nazi expropriation of Jewish property from a scholarly rather than legal perspective, partly in response to continuing criticism of its handling of property claims. Its membership was based on recommendations from various quarters, including [[Simon Wiesenthal]] and [[Yad Vashem]]. The Commission delivered its report in 2003. {{ref|report}} Noted Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] refused to participate in the Commission and in an interview stated his strenuous objections in terms both personal and in reference to larger questions about Austrian culpability and liability, comparing what he to be relative inattention to the settlement governing the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank holdings of those who died or were displaced by the Holocaust:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I personally would like to know why the WJC &amp;#91;[[World Jewish Congress]]&amp;#93; has hardly put any pressure on Austria, even as leading Nazis and SS leaders were Austrians, Hitler included... Immediately after the war, the US wanted to make the Russians withdraw from Austria, and the Russians wanted to keep Austria neutral, therefore there was a common interest to grant Austria victim status. And later Austria could cry poor - though its per capita income is as high as Germany's. And, most importantly, the Austrian PR machinery works better. Austria has the opera ball, the imperial castle, Mozartkugeln [a chocolate]. Americans like that. And Austrians invest and export relatively little to the US, therefore they are less vulnerable to blackmail. In the meantime, they set up a commission in Austria to clarify what happened to Jewish property. Victor Klima, the former chancellor, has asked me to join. My father fought for Austria in the First World War and in 1939 he was kicked out of Austria. After the war they offered him ten dollars per month as compensation. For this reason I told Klima, no thank you, this makes me sick. {{ref|Hilberg}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] continues to criticise Austria (as recently as June 2005) for its alleged historical and ongoing unwillingness aggressively to pursue investigations and trials against Nazis for war crimes and crimes against humanity from the seventies onwards. Its 2001 report offered the following characterization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Given the extensive participation of numerous Austrians, including at the highest levels, in the implementation of the Final Solution and other Nazi crimes, Austria should have been a leader in the prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators over the course of the past four decades, as has been the case in Germany. Unfortunately relatively little has been achieved by the Austrian authorities in this regard and in fact, with the exception of the case of Dr. Heinrich Gross which was suspended this year under highly suspicious circumstances (he claimed to be medically unfit, but outside the court proved to be healthy) not a single Nazi war crimes prosecution has been conducted in Austria since the mid-seventies.{{ref|Simon}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003 the Center launched a worldwide effort named &quot;Operation: Last Chance&quot; in order to collect further information about those Nazis still alive that are potentially subject to prosecution. Although reports issued shortly thereafter credited Austria for initiating large-scale investigations, there has been one case where criticism of Austrian authorities arose recently: The Center has put 92-year old [[Croatia]]n [[Milivoj Asner]] on its 2005 top ten list. Asner fled to Austria in 2004 after Croatia announced it would start investigations in the case of war crimes he may have been involved in. In response to objections about Asner's continued freedom, Austria's federal government has deferred to either extradition requests from Croatia or prosecutorial actions from [[Klagenfurt]], neither of which appears forthcoming (as of June 2005). {{ref|asner}} Extradition is not an option since Asner also holds Austrian [[citizenship]], having lived in the country from 1946 to 1991. {{ref|asner_citizen}}

The '''American Civil War''' (1861&amp;ndash;1865) was a [[civil war]] between the [[United States |United States of America]], called the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and the [[Confederate States of America]], formed by eleven [[Southern United States|Southern states]] that had [[secession|seceded]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Confederate States of America#International Diplomacy and Legal Status|[1]]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; from the Union. The Union won a decisive victory, followed by a period of [[Reconstruction]]. The war produced more than 970,000 casualties (3 percent of population), including approximately 560,000 deaths. The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for the outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]], are subjects of much controversy, even today. 



==Historiography: Multiple explanations of why War began ==
:''Main articles: [[Origins of the American Civil War]], [[Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War|Timeline of events]]''

The '''origin of the American Civil War''' lay in the complex issues of [[slavery]], [[Second Party System|politics]], disagreements over the scope of [[States' rights]] versus federal power, [[expansionism]], [[sectionalism]], economics, modernization, and competing nationalism of the [[Antebellum]] period.  Although there is little disagreement among historians on the details of the events that led to war, there is disagreement on exactly what caused what and the relative importance.  There is no consensus on whether the war could have been avoided, or if it should have been avoided.

===Failure to compromise===
In 1854 the old political system broke down after passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Whig Party disappeared, and the new [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] arose in its place. It was the nation's first major political party with only sectional appeal; though it had much of the old Whig economic platform, its popularity rested on its commitment to stop the expansion of slavery into new territories. Open warfare in the Kansas Territory, the [[panic of 1857]], and John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry further heightened sectional tensions and helped Republicans sweep elections in 1860. In 1860, [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|the election of Abraham Lincoln]], who met staunch opposition from Southern slave-owning interests, triggered Southern secession from the union. The new president decided to resort to arms, if necessary, to preserve the nation's territorial integrity.

Historians in the 1930s such as [[James G. Randall]] argued that the rise of mass democracy, the breakdown of the [[Second Party System|old two-party system]], and increasingly virulent and hostile sectional rhetoric made it highly unlikely, if not impossible, to bring about the compromises of the past (such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] and the [[Compromise of 1850]]) necessary to avoid crisis. Although numerous compromises were proposed, none were successful in reuniting the country.  One possible &quot;compromise&quot; was peaceful secession agreed to by the United States, which was seriously discussed in late 1860&amp;mdash;and supported by many abolitionists&amp;mdash;but was rejected by both Buchanan's conservative Democrats and the Republican leadership.

===Southern nationalism: Psychological nationhood===
Most historians agree, following [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], [[Avery Craven]], and [[Eugene Genovese]] that the South had grown apart from the North psychologically and in terms of its value systems.  One by one the common elements that bound the nation together were broken. For example the major Protestant denominations split along North-South lines. Fewer travelers or students or businessmen went from one region to the other. The last common elements were the Constitution (which was in dispute after the [[Dred Scott]] ruling of 1857); the political parties (which split along regional lines in 1860), and Congress, which was in constant turmoil after 1856.

===Slavery as a cause of the War===
Focus on the slavery issue has been cyclical. It was considered the main cause in the 1860&amp;ndash;1890 era. From 1900 to 1960, historians considered anti-slavery agitation to be less important than constitutional, economic, and cultural issues. Since the 1960s historians have returned to an emphasis on slavery as a major cause of the war. Specifically, they note that the South insisted on protecting it and the North insisted on weakening it. A small but militant abolitionist movement existed in the North--a matter of a few thousand advocates. Their insistence that slavery was a sin and slave owners were deeply guilty angered the South.  Historians have looked at many slave owners and decided that they felt neither guilt nor shame, but were angry at what they considered unchristian hate speech from abolitionists. By the 1830s there was a widespread ideological defense of the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; everywhere in the South. 

As [[United States territorial acquisitions|territorial expansion]] forced the nation to confront the question of whether new territories were to become &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;free,&quot; and as multiplying free states became a majority in the Union, the [[Slave Power]] in national politics waned. 

===Economics===
The North and South did have different economies but they were complementary and not in competition. The South made money by exporting cotton (and other unique crops like tobacco). The North made money by exporting food and manufactured items. Many northern business interests were closely tied to the Southern economy and pleaded for union and compromise.  Some Southerners thought they paid too much in tariffs--but they themselves had written and voted for the tariff laws in effect.

The cotton-growing export business  or &quot;[[King Cotton]],&quot; as it was touted, was so important to the world economy, southerners argued, that they could stand alone. Indeed, being tied to the North was a hindrance and an economic burden. The South would do better by trading directly with Europe and avoiding extortionate Yankee middlemen.

===Ideologies===
In the view of many northern Republicans, the [[Slave Power]] ruled the South, not democracy. This &quot;Slave Power&quot; was a small group of very wealthy slave owners, especially cotton planters, who dominated the politics and society of the South. However, historians more recently have emphasized that the South was much more democratic than the Republicans of North believed.
Both North and South believed strongly to republican values of democracy and civic virtue.  But their conceptualizations were diverging. Each side though the other was aggressive, and was violating both the Constitution and the core values of American republicanism.  Nationalism was the dominant force in Europe in the 19th century and likewise in America. The South was much more explicit in defining nationalism as a regional characteristic. The North paid less attention to nationalism before 1860, but then focused its mind on it and stressed the whole country, North and South, was the unit of nationalism. 

This economic differentiation had social and political consequences beyond the issue of slavery itself; for instance, Pennsylvania politicians pushed for a protective tariff to help the iron industry, while the cotton-exporting South wanted to keep the existing policy of nearly free trade. 

At a deeper level industrialization in the Northeast and farming in the Midwest depended on free labor, which could not exist alongside slave labor, as Lincoln kept emphasizing. The nation had to be all free or all slave, said Lincoln. 
(Historians [[Charles Beard|Charles and Mary Beard]] went so far as to argue in 1928 that this sectional conflict was a &quot;Second American Revolution&quot;&amp;mdash;a revolutionary watershed in the rise of modern industrial society in the United States.) 

===States Rights===
The States' rights debate cut across the issues. Southern politicians argued that the federal government had no power to prevent slaves from being carried into new territories, but they also demanded federal jurisdiction over slaves who escaped into the North; Northern politicians took reversed, though equally contradictory, stances on these issues.


===Slavery in the Territories===
The specific political crisis that culminated in secession and civil war stemmed from a dispute over the expansion of slavery into new territories. The reason was that Congress had power over slavery in the territories, but not in the states.  With new territories being formed--especially Kansas--the issue of slaver had to be confronted.  This argument grew out of the acquisition of vast new lands during the [[Mexican War]] (1846&amp;ndash;48). Free-state politicians such as David Wilmot, who personally had no sympathy for abolitionism, feared that slaves would provide too much competition for free labor, and thus effectively keep free-state migrants out of newly opened territories. Slaveholders felt that any ban on slaves in the territories was a discrimination against their peculiar form of property, and would undercut both the financial value of slaves and the institution itself. (Slaves comprised the second most valuable form of property in the South, after real estate.) In Congress, the end of the Mexican War was overshadowed by a fight over the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a provision that Wilmot tried (and failed) to enact to bar slavery from all lands acquired in the conflict.

The dispute led to open warfare after the [[Kansas]] Territory was organized in the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854. This act repealed the prohibition on slavery there under the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and put the fate of slavery in the hands of the territory's settlers, a process known as &quot;popular sovereignty.&quot; Proslavery Missourians expected that Kansas, due west of their state, would naturally become a slave state, and were alarmed by an organized migration of antislavery New Englanders. Soon heavily armed &quot;border ruffians&quot; from Missouri battled antislavery forces under [[John Brown]], among other leaders. Hundreds were killed or wounded. Southern congressmen, perceiving a Northern conspiracy to keep slavery out of Kansas, insisted that it be admitted as a slave state. Northerners, pointing to the large and growing majority of antislavery voters there, denounced this effort. By 1860, sectional divisions had grown deep and bitter.

===Southern fears of Modernity===
Southern secession was triggered by the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] because it was feared that he would make good on his promise to stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction.  If not Lincoln, then sooner or later another Yankee, many Southerners said; it was time to quit the Union. The slave states had lost the balance of power in the Electoral College and the Senate, and were facing a future as a perpetual minority. In a broader sense the North was rapidly modernizing its economy and its world view; slavery had no role in modern America. Historian James McPherson (1983 p 283) explains:

{{Quotation|When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them. The South's concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North's had. ... The ascension to power of the Republican Party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening, revolutionary future.|James McPherson|&quot;Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question,&quot; Civil War History 29 (Sept. 1983)}}

===Secession===
Before Lincoln took office, seven states seceded from the Union, and established an independent Southern government, the [[Confederate States of America]] on [[February 9]], [[1861]]. They took control of federal forts and property within their boundaries, with little resistance from President Buchanan. By seceding, the rebel states gave up any claim to the Western territories that were in dispute, canceled any obligation for the North to return fugitive slaves to the Confederacy, and assured easy passage in Congress of many bills and amendments they had long opposed. 

The Civil War began when, under orders from [[President of the Confederate States | Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] opened fire upon [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on [[April 12]], [[1861]]. There were no casualties from enemy fire in this battle.

==Division of the country==
===The Union States ===	 
{{main|Union (American Civil War)}}	 
There were 23 Union States: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. The Union counted [[Virginia]] as well, and added [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]]. It added [[Tennessee]], [[Louisiana]], and other rebel states as soon as they were reconquered.	 
		 
The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] also fought on the Union side. There was a civil war inside the [[Oklahoma territory]].

===The Confederacy===
{{main|Confederate States of America}}

Seven states seceded by March 1861: 
*[[South Carolina]] ([[December 21]] [[1860]]),
*[[Mississippi]] ([[January 9]] [[1861]]),
*[[Florida]] ([[January 10]] [[1861]]),
*[[Alabama]] ([[January 11]] [[1861]]),
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ([[January 19]] [[1861]]),
*[[Louisiana]] ([[January 26]] [[1861]]),
*[[Texas]] ([[February 1]] [[1861]]).

These states of the [[Deep South]], where [[slavery]] and [[cotton]] were most dominant, formed the Confederate States of America ([[February 4]] [[1861]]), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a governmental structure closely modeled on the [[U.S. Constitution]] ''(see also: [[Confederate States Constitution]])''. 
[[Image:Civilwarmap2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Map of the division of the states during the Civil War. Blue represents Union states; light blue, Union states that permitted [[Slavery in Colonial America|slavery]]; gray, Confederate states; green, Territories.]]
After the surrender of [[Fort Sumter]], [[April 13]], [[1861]], Lincoln called for troops from all states to put down the insurrection, resulting in the secession of four more states: 

*[[Virginia]] ([[April 17]] [[1861]]), 
*[[Arkansas]] ([[May 6]] [[1861]]), 
*[[North Carolina]] ([[May 20]] [[1861]]), and 
*[[Tennessee]] ([[June 8]] [[1861]]).

===Border states===
''Main article: [[Border states (Civil War)]]''

Along with the northwestern portion of Virginia (whose residents did not wish to secede and eventually entered the Union in 1863 as [[West Virginia]]), four of the five northernmost &quot;[[slave state]]s&quot; ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]) did not secede, and became known as the [[Border States (Civil War)|Border States]]. There was considerable anti-war or &quot;[[Copperhead]]&quot; sentiment in the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and some men volunteered for Confederate service; however much larger numbers, led by [[John A. Logan]], joined the Union army.

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials, but after [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and other events had prompted a Federal declaration of [[martial law]], Union troops moved in, and arrested the pro-Confederates.  Both [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] remained in the Union, but factions within each state organized governments in exile that were recognized by the CSA.

In Missouri, an elected convention on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. However, pro-Southern Governor [[Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, which was attacked in St. Louis by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]'').

[[Image:Map of CSA 3.png|thumb|300px|Map of territory claimed by the Confederacy]]

Although Kentucky did not secede, for a time it declared itself [[neutral]]. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Southern sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a Confederate Governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. However, the military occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky | Columbus]] by Confederate General [[Leonidas Polk]] in September 1861 turned general popular opinion in Kentucky against the Confederacy, and the state subsequently reaffirmed its loyal status and expelled the Confederate government. 

Residents of the northwestern counties of Virginia organized a secession from Virginia and entered the Union in 1863 as [[West Virginia]]. Similar secessions were supported in some other areas of the Confederacy (such as eastern [[Tennessee]]), but were suppressed by declarations of martial law by the Confederacy. 
&lt;!-- California not unique in having split sentiments
[[History of California#California and the Civil War|California]] was a [[free state]] and a part of the Union. Lincoln had won a [[plurality]] there, but there were a number of Southern sympathizers. 2% of its votes went to the Southern Democrat candidate, [[John C. Breckinridge]]. California's soldiers were kept under state control and were used to keep the land routes between the Mississippi and the state open. California gold helped finance the Union war effort.[http://www.militarymuseum.org/HistoryCW.html]

==Narrative summary: 1861 to Fort Sumter==
[[Image:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|right|350px|Battles of the American Civil War by Theater, Year]]
Lincoln's victory in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's secession from the Union. By [[February 1]], [[1861]], six more Southern states had seceded. On [[February 7]], the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The pre-war February [[peace conference of 1861]] met in Washington, as one last attempt to avoid war; it failed. The remaining southern states as yet remained in the Union. Confederate forces seized all but three federal forts within their boundaries (they did not take Fort Sumter); President Buchanan made no military response, but governors in Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania began secretly buying weapons and training militia units to ready them for immediate action.

On [[March 4]], [[1861]], Abraham Lincoln was sworn in. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a ''more perfect union'' than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called the secession &quot;legally void&quot;. He stated he had no intent to invade southern states, but would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. The South did send delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties, but they were turned down. Lincoln refused to negotiate with any Confederate agents because he insisted the Confederacy was not a legitimate government. 

On [[April 12]], Confederate soldiers fired upon the Federal troops stationed at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], until the troops surrendered. Lincoln called for all of the states in the Union to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. Most Northerners hoped that a quick victory for the Union would crush the nascent rebellion, and so Lincoln only called for volunteers for 90 days. Four states, Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and&amp;mdash;most importantly, Virginia&amp;mdash;which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures now decided that they could not send forces against the seceding states. They seceded and to reward Virginia the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]], a highly vulnerable location at the end of the supply line.

Even though the Southern states had seceded, there was considerable anti-secessionist sentiment within several of the seceding states. Eastern Tennessee, in particular, was a hotbed for pro-Unionism. [[Winston County, Alabama]] issued a resolution of secession from the state of Alabama. The ''[[Red Strings (American politics)|Red Strings]]'' were a prominent Southern anti-secession group.

[[Winfield Scott]] created the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a [[Union blockade]] would strangle the rebel economy, then capture of the Mississippi would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan but overruled  Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.

===Naval war and blockade===
{{see details|Naval Battles of the American Civil War}}[[Union blockade]] and [[Confederate States Navy]]
In May 1861 Lincoln proclaimed the [[Union blockade]] of all southern ports, which shut down nearly all international traffic and most local port-to-port traffic. Although few naval battles were fought and few men were killed, the blockade shut down [[King Cotton]] and ruined the southern economy.  British investors built small, very fast &quot;blockade runners&quot; that brought in military supplies (and civilian luxuries) from Cuba and the Bahamas and took out some cotton and tobacco. When the blockade captured one the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Union sailors. The crews were British, so when they were captured they were released and not held as prisoners of war. The most famous naval battle was the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] (often called &quot;the Battle of the ''Monitor'' and the ''Merrimac''&quot;) in March 1862, in which Confederate efforts to break the blockade were frustrated. Other naval battles included [[Battle of Island Number Ten | Island No. 10]], [[Battle of Memphis | Memphis]], [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff | Drewry's Bluff]], [[Battle of Fort Hindman | Arkansas Post]], and [[Battle of Mobile Bay | Mobile Bay]].

===Eastern Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}
Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'', whereupon they were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by Confederate troops under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and P.G.T. Beauregard. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the name of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on [[July 25]] of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end [[slavery]].

Major General [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on [[July 26]] (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in [[1862]].

Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan invaded Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then [[Robert E. Lee]] defeated him in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. McClellan was stripped of many of his troops to reinforce [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s Union [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope was beaten spectacularly by Lee in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] and the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in August.

[[Image:conf_dead_chancellorsville.jpg|thumb|300px|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863.]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 55,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into [[Maryland]] on [[September 5]]. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]], on [[September 17]] [[1862]], the bloodiest single day in American history. Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided justification for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside suffered near-immediate defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] on [[December 13]] [[1862]], when over ten thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker|Joseph &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker]]. Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] ([[July 1]]&amp;ndash;[[July 3|3]], [[1863]]), the largest battle in North American history, which is sometimes considered the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000), again forcing it to retreat to Virginia, never to launch a full-scale invasion of the North again. Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.

===Western Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1863===
{{see details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they crucially failed in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]]. [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Kentucky]] enraged the citizens there who previously had declared neutrality in the war, turning that state against the Confederacy.

[[Nashville, Tennessee]], fell to the Union early in 1862. Most of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was captured in May 1862, allowing the Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi as well. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], prevented unchallenged Union control of the entire river.

[[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky was repulsed by [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the confused and bloody [[Battle of Perryville]] and he was narrowly defeated by [[William S. Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]] in [[Tennessee]].

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], near the [[Tennessee]] border, where Bragg, reinforced by the corps of [[James Longstreet]] (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of [[George Henry Thomas]], and forced him to retreat to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the west was Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at: Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]], by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River |Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers; [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]]; the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], cementing Union control of the Mississippi River and considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War |turning points]] of the war; and the  [[Battle of Chattanooga III|Battle of Chattanooga, Tennessee]], driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening an invasion route to [[Atlanta, Georgia |Atlanta]] and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi Theater 1861&amp;ndash;1865===
{{see details| Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
Though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, a number of small-scale military actions took place west of the Mississippi River. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico were repulsed in 1862. Guerilla activity turned much of Missouri and Indian Territory (Oklahoma) into a battleground. Late in the war the Federal [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off after the capture of [[Vicksburg]] in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

===End of the War 1864&amp;ndash;1865===
[[Image:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jefferson Davis]], first and only President of the Confederate States of America]]

At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war.  He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals Grant, Meade, and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] would move against Lee near Richmond; General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) would [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|invade the Shenandoah Valley]]; General Sherman would and capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea; Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] would operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]]; and General [[Nathaniel Prentiss Banks|Nathaniel Banks]] would capture [[Mobile, Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign | Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 66,000 casualties in six weeks), kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan proved to be more than a match for [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and defeated him in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]], Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Valley, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman would later employ in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman marched from [[Chattanooga]] to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John B. Hood]]. The fall of Atlanta, on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the re-election of Abraham Lincoln, as President of the Union. Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unclear destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his celebrated &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;, and reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] in December 1864. Burning plantations as they went, Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves.  When Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Virginia lines from the south, it was the end for Lee and his men, and for the Confederacy.

Lee attempted to escape from the besieged Petersburg and link up with Johnston in [[North Carolina]], but he was overtaken by Grant. He surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on [[April 9]], [[1865]], at [[Appomattox Court House]]. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman shortly thereafter at a [[Bennett Place|local family's farmhouse]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. The [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought on [[May 13]], [[1865]], in the far south of [[Texas]], was the last Civil War land battle and ended, ironically, with a Confederate victory. All Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865.

==Analysis of the outcome==
Why the Union prevailed (or why the Confederacy was defeated) in the Civil War has been a subject of extensive analysis and debate. 

Could the South have won? A significant number of scholars believe that the Union held an insurmountable advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength, population, and the determination to win. Confederate actions, they argue, could only delay defeat. Southern historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly in Ken Burns's television series on the Civil War: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back.... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot; [Ward 1990 p 272]

Other historians, however, suggest that the South had a chance to win its independence.  As James McPherson has observed, the Confederacy remained on the defensive, which required fewer military resources. The Union, committed to the strategic offensive, faced enormous manpower demands that it often had difficulty meeting.  War weariness among Union civilians mounted along with casualties, in the long years before Union advantages proved decisive. Thus, the inevitability of Union victory remains hotly contested among scholars.

The goals were not symmetric. To win independence the South had to convince the North it could not win, but it did not have to invade the North. To restore the Union the North had to conquer vast stretches of territory. In the short run (a matter of months) the two sides were evenly matched. But in the long run (a matter of years) the North had advantages that increasingly came into play.

Both sides had long-term advantages but the Union had more of them. The Union had to control the entire coastline, defeat all the main Confederate armies, seize Richmond, and control most of the population centers. As the occupying force they had to station hundreds of thousands of soldiers to control railroads, supply lines, and major towns and cites. The long-term advantages widely credited by historians to have contributed to the Union's success include:
[[Image:Advantages.jpg|right|350px|US economic advantages over CSA]]
*The more industrialized economy of the North, which aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The graph shows the relative advantage of the USA over the CSA.
*A [[Second Party System| party system]] that enabled the Republicans to mobilize soldiers and support at the grass roots, even when the war became unpopular. The Confederacy deliberately did not use parties.
*The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. 
*Excellent railroad links between Union cities, which allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller system or repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. 
*The Union devoted much more of its resources to medical needs, thereby overcoming the unhealthy disease environment that sickened (and killed) more soldiers than combat did.
*The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. 
*The Union's more established government, particularly a mature executive branch which accumulated even greater power during wartime, may have resulted in less regional infighting and a more streamlined conduct of the war. Failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors damaged the Confederate president's ability to draw on regional resources.
*The Confederacy's tactic of engaging in major battles at the cost of heavy manpower losses, when it could not easily replace its losses.  
*The Confederacy's [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HZY/is_1_14/ai_78397581 failure] to fully use its advantages in guerrilla warfare against Union communication and transportation infrastructure.  However, as Lee warned, such warfare would prove devastating to the South, and (with the exception of Confederate partisans in Missouri) Confederate leaders shrank from it.
*Despite the Union's many tactical blunders like the [[Seven Days Battle]], those commited by Confederate generals, such as Lee's miscalculations at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam]], were far more serious&amp;mdash;if for no other reason than that the Confederates could so little afford the losses.  
*Lincoln proved more adept than Davis in replacing unsuccessful generals with better ones. 
*Strategically the location of the capital Richmond tied Lee to a highly exposed position at the end of supply lines. (Loss of Richmond, everyone realized, meant loss of the war.) 
*Lincoln grew as a grand strategist, in contrast to Davis. The Confederacy never developed an overall strategy. It never had a plan to deal with the blockade. Davis failed to respond in a coordinated fashion to serious threats, such as Grant's campaign against Vicksburg in 1863 (in the face of which, he allowed Lee to invade Pennsylvania).
*The Confederacy's failure to win diplomatic or military support from any foreign powers. Its [[King Cotton]] misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. 
* Most important, the Union had the will to win, and leaders like Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Grant, and Sherman would do whatever it took to achieve victory. The Confederacy, as Beringer et al (1986) argue, may have lacked the total commitment needed to win. It took time, however, for leaders such as Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan to emerge; in the meantime, Union public opinion wavered, and Lincoln worried about losing the election of 1864, until victories in the Shenandoah Valley and Atlanta made victory seem likely.

==Major land battles==
There were as many as 10,000 hostile engagements during the war. The costliest and most significant are listed in [[Battles of the American Civil War]].

==Civil War leaders and soldiers==
[[Image:Lincoln and Davis Statue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statues of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Jefferson Davis]] at [[Vicksburg National Military Park]].]]

One of the reasons that the U.S. Civil War wore on as long as it did and the battles were so fierce was that most important generals on both sides had formerly served in the [[United States Army]]&amp;mdash;some, including [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], during the [[Mexican-American War]] between 1846 and 1848. Most were graduates of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.
Southern military commanders and strategists included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]], [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]], [[James Longstreet]], [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], [[John Mosby]], [[Braxton Bragg]], [[John Bell Hood]], [[JEB Stuart|James Ewell Brown (JEB) Stuart]], [[William Mahone]], [[Judah P. Benjamin]], [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].

Northern military commanders and strategists included [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[George H. Thomas]], [[George B. McClellan]], [[Henry W. Halleck]], [[Joseph Hooker]], [[Ambrose Burnside]], [[Irvin McDowell]], [[Winfield Scott]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[George Crook]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[George G. Meade]], and [[Winfield Hancock]]

After 1980, scholarly attention turned to ordinary soldiers, and to women and African Americans involved with the War. As James McPherson observed &quot;The profound irony of the Civil War was that Confederate and Union soldiers ... interpreted the heritage of 1776 in opposite ways. Confederates fought for liberty and independence from what they regarded as a tyrannical government; Unionists fought to preserve the nation created by the founders from dismemberment and destruction.&quot;(McPherson 1994 p 24)

==The Question of Slavery==
Given the painfulness of the historical memory of slavery for many Americans, its role in the war remains controversial to this day. To understand its place in the conflict, it is necessary to divide the issue in two: slavery as a motivation for secession, and abolition as a Union war aim.

In the weeks and months preceding the secession of the Confederate states, Southern leaders spoke openly about their desire to preserve slavery, and their fears for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; if the South remained within the Union. Almost all of the ordinances of secession cited the preservation of slavery as a primary, even the foremost, reason for departure from the Union. And yet many individual Southern soldiers fought for reasons quite apart from the defense of slavery: to protect their families and communities, to defend their home states, and out of a nascent sense of nationality. 

On the Union side, Lincoln initially declared his purpose in prosecuting the war to be the preservation of the Union, not emancipation. He had no wish to alienate the thousands of slaveholders in the Union border states. The long war, however, had a radicalizing effect on federal policies. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced in September 1862 and put into effect four months later, Lincoln adopted the abolition of the [[Slave Power]] as a second mission&amp;mdash;that is slaves owned by rebels had to be taken away from them and freed. One goal was to destroy the economic basis of the Confederate leadership class, and another goal was to actually liberate the 4 million slaves, which was accomplished by 1865.

The Emancipation Proclamation declared all slaves held in territory then under Confederate control  to be &quot;then, thenceforth, and forever free,&quot; but did not affect slaves in areas under Union control. It did, however, show the Union that slavery's days were numbered, increasing abolitionist support in the North. The border states (except Kentucky) abolished slavery on their own.

==Foreign diplomacy==
Because of the Confederacy's attempt to create a new state, recognition and support from the European powers were critical to its prospects. The Union, under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward]] attempted to block the Confederacy's efforts in this sphere. The Confederates hoped that the importance of the cotton trade to Europe (the idea of [[cotton diplomacy]]) and shortages caused by the war, along with early military victories, would enable them to gather increasing European support and force a turn away from neutrality.

President Lincoln's decision to announce a [[Union blockade|blockade of the Confederacy]], a clear act of war, enabled Britain, followed by other European powers, to announce their neutrality in the dispute. This enabled the Confederacy to begin to attempt to gain support and funds in Europe. President Jefferson Davis had picked [[Robert Toombs]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as his first Secretary of State. Toombs, having little knowledge in foreign affairs, was replaced several months later by [[Robert M. T. Hunter]] of [[Virginia]], another choice with little suitability. Ultimately, on [[March 17]], [[1862]], Davis selected [[Judah P. Benjamin]] of [[Louisiana]] as Secretary of State, who although having more international knowledge and legal experience with international slavery disputes still failed in the end to create a dynamic foreign policy for the Confederacy.

The first attempts to achieve European recognition of the Confederacy were dispatched on [[February 25]], [[1861]] and led by [[William Lowndes Yancey]], [[Pierre A. Rost]], and [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]]. The British foreign minister [[Lord John Russell]] met with them, and the French foreign minister [[Edouard Thouvenel]] received the group unofficially. However, at this point, the two countries had agreed to coordinate and cooperate and would not make any rash moves.

[[Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as ambassador to Britain for the Union, and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the Union's blockade. The Confederacy also attempted to initiate propaganda in Europe through journalists [[Henry Hotze]] and [[Edwin De Leon]] in [[Paris]] and [[London]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. A significant challenge in Anglo-Union relations was also created by the [[Trent Affair]], involving the Union boarding of a British mail steamer to seize [[James M. Mason]] and [[John Slidell]], Confederate diplomats sent to Europe. However, the Union was able to smooth over the problem to some degree.

As the war continued, in late 1862, the British considered initiating an attempt to mediate the conflict. However, the Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. Additionally, the issuing of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. As the war continued, the Confederacy's chances with Britain grew more hopeless, and they focused increasingly on France. [[Napoléon III]] proposed to offer mediation in January 1863, but this was dismissed by Seward. Despite some sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|concerns in Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from substantially antagonizing the Union. As the Confederacy's situation grew more and more tenuous and their pleas increasingly ignored, President Davis sent [[Duncan F. Kenner]] to Europe, in November 1864, to test whether a promised Confederate emancipation of its slaves could lead to possible recognition. The proposal was strictly rejected by both Britain and France.

==Aftermath==
{{main|Reconstruction}}
[[Image:Peace_Monument_Chattanooga.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Peace Monument'' at [[Lookout Mountain]], [[Tennessee]] depicts a Union and Confederate soldier shaking hands.]]
Northern leaders agreed that the war would be over when Confederate nationalism was dead, and slavery was dead.  They disagreed sharply on how to identify these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South. 
The fighting ended with the surrender of all the Confederate forces. There was no significant guerrilla warfare.  Many senior Confederate leaders escaped to Europe, but Davis was captured and imprisoned, but never brought to trial. The question became how much the Union could trust the ex-Confederates to be truly loyal to the United States. The second main question in Reconstruction dealt with the destruction of slavery. The XIII Amendment (1865) officially abolished it legally, but the issue was whether [[black codes]] indicated a sort of semi-slavery, and whether Freedmen should have the vote to protect those rights. 
In 1867 Radicals in Congress pushed aside President Johnson and imposed new rules. Freedmen gained the right to vote and formed Republican political coalitions that took control of each state for varying periods. One by one the white conservatives or &quot;[[Redeemers]]&quot; gained back control of their states, often through lethal force. The final three were redeemed by the [[Compromise of 1877]]. After that the hatreds between North and South rapidly diminished until by 1900 the nation was no longer divided by the war, though it did remain divided by race.

Ghosts of the conflict still persist in America. For decades after the war, Northern politicians &quot;waved the bloody shirt,&quot; bringing up memories of the Civil War as an electoral tactic, while the &quot;solid South&quot; as a block in national politics was built on memories of the war and a determination to maintain segregation.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s had its [[neoabolitionist]] roots in the failure of Reconstruction. A few debates surrounding the legacy of the war continue, especially regarding memorials and celebrations of Confederate heroes and [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Controversy|battle flags]]. The question is a deep and troubling one: Americans with Confederate ancestors cherish the memory of their bravery and determination, yet their cause remains one ultimately tied to the shameful history of African American slavery.

'''Andy Warhol''' ([[August 6]], [[1928]] – [[February 22]], [[1987]]) was an [[United States|American]] painter, filmmaker, publisher, actor, and a major figure in the [[Pop Art]] movement.

== Biography ==
Warhol was born as '''Andrew Warhola''' in [[Forest City, Pennsylvania]]. His parents, Ondrej (Andrew) Warhola and Julia Zavacky, were working class immigrants of [[Rusyns|Ruthenian ethnicity]] from [[Mikova]], in northeast [[Slovakia]]; his father worked in the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]]. The family was [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] but Warhol's mother had a [[Jewish]] grandmother.[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0815410085/qid=1141095641/sr=1-33/ref=sr_1_33/104-6359540-7548710?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155]

Warhol showed early artistic talent and studied [[commercial art]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1949 he moved to [[New York City]] and began a successful career in [[magazine]] illustration and [[advertising]]. He became well-known mainly for his whimsical ink drawings of shoes done in a loose, blotted style.

In the 1960s, Warhol began to make paintings of famous American products such as [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]] cans and [[Coca-Cola]]. He switched to [[silkscreen]] prints, seeking not only to make art of mass produced items, but to mass produce the art itself. He said that he wanted to be like a robot. He hired and supervised &quot;art workers&quot; engaged in making prints, shoes, films, books and other items at his studio, ''[[The Factory]]'', located on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] in New York City. Warhol's body of work furthermore includes commissioned portraits and commercials.

A lot of Warhol's works revolve around the concept of [[Americana]] and American culture. He painted money, dollar signs, food, groceries, women's shoes, celebrities, and newspaper clippings. To him, these subjects represented American cultural values. For instance, Coca-Cola represents democratic equality because

:&quot;What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.&quot; 

He used popular imagery and methods to visualize the American cultural identity of the 20th century.  This popular redefinition of American culture is a theme and result of Warhol's art. Because American culture has had great international influence, Warhol did as well.

Outside of the art world, Andy Warhol is best known for saying that &quot;In the future, everyone will be world famous for [[15 minutes of fame|15 minutes]].&quot;  He later told reporters, humorously, &quot;My new line is, 'In fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.'&quot;

=== Socialite and Recluse ===
Warhol used to socialize at [[Serendipity (nightclub)|Serendipity]] and [[Studio 54]], nightclubs in New York City. Warhol was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and as a meticulous observer. More than one person jokingly referred to him as &quot;death warmed over.&quot; 

Warhol was openly gay, rare for celebrities of his stature at the time. Many people think of Warhol as [[asexual]] and as merely a [[voyeur]], but these notions have been debunked by biographers (like [[Fred Guiles]]), scholars (e.g. [[Richard Meyer]]), personal accounts of relationships by ex-lovers such as Jed Johnson and Billy Name, and by the overtly campy and homoerotic nature of his work itself. Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of [[Liza Minelli]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and films like &quot;My Hustler&quot;, &quot;[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]&quot;, and &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot;) draw from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire.  In fact, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.  The first works that he submitted to a gallery in the pursuit of a career as an artist were, in fact, homoerotic drawings of male nudes. They were rejected for being too openly gay.

A meticulous collector, he organized almost every piece of paper, fan mail&amp;mdash;after taking off the stamps&amp;mdash;and magazine related to his fame along with personal notes, gay pornography and found artifacts into hundreds of numbered boxes and set them aside, never to open them again. Warhol referred to these boxes as his &quot;time capsule&quot;. Many exist today and are available for research at his Pittsburgh [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|museum]].  Warhol's house was filled to the brim with his collected art, artifacts, and Americana.

Many of his later commissioned portraits were a direct or indirect result of this networking. As a famous artist, Warhol and his Factory attracted and facilitated many &quot;groupies&quot; and friends that Warhol would include in films and happenings. Warhol promoted these [[the factory|factory]] regulars to fame, creating the [[Warhol superstars]]. They would appear in and help him make his work, play in his movies, write his books, hang out and generally become his following. 

When Warhol was asked to give a series of university lectures that he didn't feel like doing, one of his friends put on a wig and white make-up, and pretended to be him by sitting quietly on the stage. Other Superstars explained Warhol's work to the audience, and urged them to drop out of college. The University eventually found out Warhol's &quot;fraud&quot; and the following dispute had to be settled with a refund.

Warhol would regularly volunteer at the homeless shelters in New York, particularly during the busier times of the year. He described himself as a religious person, although not fully accepted by religion because of his homosexuality. Many of his later works contain almost hidden religious themes or subjects, and a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.

=== Shooting ===
On [[June 3]], [[1968]], [[Valerie Solanas]], a [[The Factory|Factory]] regular, entered Warhol's studio and fired three shots at Warhol, nearly killing him. Although the first two rounds missed, the third passed through Warhol's left [[lung]], [[spleen]], [[stomach]], [[liver]], [[esophagus]], and right lung. Solanas then turned the gun on a companion of Warhol, Mario Amaya, injuring his thigh. Warhol survived his injuries, but he never fully recovered. Earlier, Solanas had given a script to Warhol, in hopes that he would make a film out of it. Warhol never did.  Apparently, she had visited the Factory earlier in the day to ask that they give the script back to her.  It had, however, been lost.  She later explained that she had attacked Warhol because, &quot;he had too much control over [her] life.&quot; The story of Valerie Solanas was made into the 1996 film ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'', starring [[Lili Taylor]] and directed by [[Mary Harron]].

In the hospital, his doctors had already declared him deceased, after which he was resuscitated. Warhol later joked that he was now invulnerable, since he had gone through death and came out alive. The shooting and Warhol's &quot;death&quot; received wide media coverage.

One of Warhol's associates, [[Paul Morrissey]], later satirized the event in his movie [[&quot;Women In Revolt&quot;]], calling a group similar to Solanas' [[S.C.U.M.]] ('''Society for Cutting Up Men'''), ''P.I.G.'' ('''Politically Involved Girls''').

In [[1990 in music|1990]] [[Lou Reed]] recorded the album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' (one of Warhol's nicknames was Drella, a combination of Dracula and Cinderella) with fellow [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] alumnus [[John Cale]].

Warhol had adopted Reed's band the Velvet Underground as one of his projects in the 1960s, &quot;producing&quot; their first album [[The Velvet Underground and Nico]] as well as providing the album art, widely regarded as some of the greatest album art of all time. The album itself is also regarded as one of the greatest (and most influential) albums in rock history. After the band became successful Warhol and band leader Reed started to disagree more and more about the direction the band should take, and the contact between them faded. On the album, Reed apologizes and comes to terms with his part in their conflict.

=== Death ===
Warhol died in New York City following routine gallbladder surgery at the age of 58. Warhol was afraid of hospitals and doctors, so he had delayed having his recurring gall bladder problems checked.

He is interred at St. John the Baptist Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, south of Pittsburgh. Fellow artist [[Yoko Ono]] was among the speakers at his funeral.

Andy Warhol had so many posessions it took [[Sotheby's]] 9 days to auction his estate after his death for a total gross amount of over 20,000,000 (USD).

== Work ==
=== Paintings ===
When he decided to pursue a career as an artist, Warhol had already established a reputation as a commercial illustrator. In school he had made paintings, but his work afterwards had mainly consisted of &quot;blotted ink&quot; illustrations for warehouses and magazines. He felt that he was not being taken seriously as an illustrator, and wanted to become a &quot;real&quot; artist.

When he started painting, he looked to find a niche for himself. At that time Pop Art - as it was later to be called - was already experimented with by several artists turning away from abstract expressionism, and Warhol turned to this new way of making art, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's vocabulary. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, in a hand-painted style, with paint drips. He added these drips to give his paintings a &quot;serious&quot; feel, to emulate a bit of the style of the abstract expressionists, that were en vogue at the time, in other words to be taken seriously or to sell his paintings, which may have had the same meaning to Warhol.

To Warhol, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter. Cartoons were already being &quot;done&quot; by [[Roy Liechtenstein]], typography by [[Jasper Johns]], et-cetera; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject. His friends suggested that he should paint the things he loved the most. In his signature way of taking things literally, for his first major exhibition he painted his famous cans of Campbell's Soup, that he had for lunch most of his life. Warhol loved money, so he later painted money. He loved celebrities, so he painted them as well.

From these beginnings he developed his later style and themes. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the hand-made from the artistic process. Warhol went from painting to silk-screening, his later drawings were traced from slide projections. In other words, Warhol went from being a painter to being a designer of paintings. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, in different versions and variations after his directions.

It has been suggested by many that Warhol would just take images of things that were hip in his time and cover them in &quot;Warhol gravy&quot;, but for Warhol there was always a personal relation between him and his subjects. For instance the Campbell's Soup did not (only) function as an illustration of commercial industry and advertisement, it was an intrinsical part of Warhol's life and memories. As a child his mother had given him this soup when he was sick, and Warhol loved it very much as a grown up. For him (and many other Americans) the soup represented a feeling of being &quot;home&quot;.

Another criterion that is important in the way Warhol chose his subjects is that the subjects should also represent a more philosophical notion, should have a metaphorical quality. When Warhol paints money, he paints it because he wants to own it - canvases filled with money. Partly, his work was meant to provide him with this money (and success and fame and maybe even love). At the same time these paintings speak of art as a commercial commodity: the paintings of dollar bills represent monetary value as well, as investments. In this way, instead of merely depicting dollar bills, these paintings touch on notions like (artistic) value, or may be perceived as a comment on art practice.

Similarly, when Warhol paints photographs of disasters in bright colors (&quot;Red Car Crash&quot;, &quot;Purple Jumping Man&quot;, &quot;Orange Disaster&quot;) they point at the horror of the event in the picture, and its media value, but also at the way in which these images are trivialized by the media. By turning these &quot;random&quot; clippings into paintings, Warhol turns them into monuments for personal tragedies. As such they represent a personal experience as well as a social comment as well as an illustration of a time when the media grew to be more and more important.

On a personal level a lot of Warhol's work is motivational in nature, and speaks of notions like democracy, being able to change things, optimistic materialism, being heard. But Warhol wasn't naively optimistic about these things, his work also deals with loss, death, loneliness and the such.
Warhol knew how to juggle many levels of meaning and interpretation, and to combine these in seemingly simple, sometimes even dumb-looking works of art. In general his work has a very high &quot;Duh!&quot; level.
Although a bit of a generalization, it may be accurate to say that Warhol depicted highly his very personal approach to subjects that everyone knows, in a way that these subjects become symbolic.

Warhol's work became more and more conceptual and more reflective of art itself. His series of Do-It-Yourself-Paintings and Rorschach-blots are intended as pop-comments on art and what art could be. His Cow Wallpaper (literally wallpaper with a cow motif) and his Oxidation Paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that show oxidated urine stains) are also noteworthy in this context. Warhol later did a series of his old works in negative, as a comment on his own position as an artist.

In the beginning of his career Warhol worked on a growing oeuvre of American forms and values, newspaper clippings, disasters, money, commercial products, Coca-Cola bottles, postal stamps, movie stars, criminals, shoes, clothes, etc. defining a position, researching and making statements. As recognition -- and the value of his work -- grew, he went back to his roots as a commercial illustrator, and starts to take commissions, most noticeably for portraits. These are sometimes viewed as Warhol's sell-out (the revolutionary painter that became a jester), but it can also be argued that his self-supporting way of working fit his world-views. At any rate, his body of portraits -- that include many celebrities, athletes, movie stars, politicians, dictators, royalty, his mother, transvestites -- have became a document of an era. Having the money or the relations to be portrayed by Warhol meant that you might be able to enter into immortality. Warhol's commercial effort also include advertisements for Chanel, Apple and more.

There are three more periods that are noteworthy in Warhol's oeuvre as a painter.
His self-portraits, of which he made many, with his silver wig, painted over with camouflage print may represent Warhol studying his own identity. Warhol has spoken about himself and was spoken about as being empty, hollow, a reflection or a mirror. The second series is his paintings of shadows. These may represent Warhol's study of the abstract. Again there is a relation with Warhol personally, as he has also depicted himself as &quot;The Shadow,&quot; the character from the radio show. Thirdly, Warhol produced many &quot;portfolios,&quot; series of small paintings meant for commercial sale. These series would be grouped around a theme; for instance, &quot;famous Jews&quot;, &quot;cars&quot;, or &quot;animals&quot;.

At one point Warhol publicly declared that he had stopped being a painter, and that he would only make films from then on; but at the end of his life, Warhol took up painting again. His last paintings and drawings are of da Vinci's ''[[Last Supper]]'', which he was working on when he died.

=== Films ===
Warhol worked across a wide range of mediums - painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture.  He was also a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than sixty films. One of his most famous films, ''[[Sleep (film)|Sleep]]'' (1963), shows a man ([[John Giorno]], who had a relationship with Warhol) sleeping for eight hours. In the 35 minute film ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' (1963), he shows the face of [[David Pelman]] receiving [[fellatio]]. Another, [[Empire (1964 film)|''Empire'']] (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City at dusk. Warhol's 1965 film ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|''Vinyl'']]'' is an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]' popular [[Dystopia|dystopian]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as Brigid Berlin, [[Viva]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], Ondine, [[Nico]], and [[Jackie Curtis]]. Legendary underground artist [[Jack Smith (actor)|Jack Smith]] appears in the film ''Camp''.

His most popular and critically successful film was ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16-mm films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot;story&quot; while it was lowered for the other. Then it would be the other film's turn to bask in the glory of sound. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s. The film's influence could be felt as late as 2000 in [[Mike Figgis]]' ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]''. 

Other important films include ''[[My Hustler (1965 film)|My Hustler]]'', ''[[Midnight Cowboy (1969 film)|Midnight Cowboy]]'', and  ''[[Lonesome Cowboys (1968 film)|Lonesome Cowboys]]'' (1968), a raunchy pseudo-western. ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a film in which Warhol superstar [[Viva (Warhol Superstar)|Viva]] makes love and fools around in bed with a man for 33 minutes of the film's playing-time, was Warhol's last film as director.  The film was at the time scandalous for its frank approach to a sexual encounter.  For many years Viva refused to allow it to be screened.  It was publicly screened in New York in 2005 for the first time in over thirty years.

After his [[June 3]], [[1968]] shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, [[Paul Morrissey]], took over the film-making chores for the [[The Factory|Factory]] collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with ''[[Flesh (film)|Flesh]]'', ''[[Trash (film)|Trash]]'', and  ''[[Heat (film)|Heat]]''. All of these films, including the later ''[[Blood for Dracula|Andy Warhol's Dracula]]'' and ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein|Andy Warhol's Frankenstein]]'', were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter &quot;Warhol&quot; films, all of which frankly were made to make money, starred [[Joe Dallesandro]], who was more of a Morrissey star than a true Warhol superstar. 

In order to facilitate the success of these Warhol-branded, Morrissey-directed movies in the marketplace, all of Warhol's earlier avant-garde films were removed from distribution and exhibition by [[1972]].  

The first volume of a catalogue raisoné for the Factory film archive is to be published in the spring of 2006.

As an actor, Warhol appeared as a bartender in [[The Cars]]' [[music video]] for their [[single (music)|single]] &quot;Hello Again&quot;, and [[Curiosity Killed The Cat]]'s video for their &quot;Misfit&quot; single (both videos, and others, were produced by Warhol's video production company).   He also appeared in an episode of [[The Love Boat]].

Warhol's character has also been represented in several motion pictures. He has been portrayed by [[Crispin Glover]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Jared Harris]], in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', ''[[Basquiat]]'', and ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]],'' respectively.

=== Books and Print ===
Warhol &quot;wrote&quot; several books.
*''[[A, a novel]]'' (1968, ISBN 0-8021-3553-6) is a literal transcription - containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling - of audio recordings of [[Ondine]] and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.
*''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol; from A to B and back again]]'' (1975, ISBN 0-15-671720-4) - according to Pat Hackett's introduction to ''The Andy Warhol Diaries'', Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with [[Brigid Berlin]] (aka Brigid Polk) and former ''Interview'' magazine editor [[Bob Colacello]].
*''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties]]'' (1980, ISBN 0-15-672960-1), authored by Warhol and [[Pat Hackett]] is a retrospective view of the sixties and the role of Pop Art.
*''[[The Andy Warhol Diaries]]'' (1989, ISBN 0-446-39138-7, edited by Pat Hackett) is an edited diary that was dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started keeping a diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited.    
        
Warhol created the fashion magazine ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.

===Other Media===
As stated, although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he has authored works in many different media.

* Drawing: Warhol started his carreer drawing commercial illustrations in &quot;blotted-ink&quot; style for warehouses and magazines. Most well known are his pictures of shoes. Some of his drawings were published in little booklets, like &quot;Yum, Yum, Yum&quot; (about food), &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho&quot; (about Christmas) and (of course) &quot;Shoes, Shoes, Shoes&quot;. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably &quot;The Gold Book&quot;, compiled of sensitive, personal drawings of young men. &quot;The Gold Book&quot; is thus dubbed because of the leaf-gold that decorates the pages.

* Sculpture: Warhol's most famous sculpture is probably his &quot;Brillo Boxes&quot;; silkscreened wooden replicas of Brillo soap boxes. Other famous works include the &quot;Silver Floating Pillows&quot;; gas-filled, silver, pillow-shaped balloons that were floated out of the window during the presentation.

* Audio: At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his &quot;wife&quot;. Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his &quot;Invisible Sculpture,&quot; a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.

* Television:  Andy Warhol dreamed of a television show that he wanted to call &quot;The Nothing Special&quot;, a Special about his favorite subject: Nothing. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, &quot;Andy Warhol's TV&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes&quot; for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest-appearances in shows like &quot;Love Boat&quot;.

* Fashion: Warhol is quoted for having said: &quot;I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?&quot; One of his most well-known Superstars, Edie Sedgwick, aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend Halston was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.

* Performance Art: Warhol and his friends staged happenings; theatrical multimedia presentations during parties, containing music, film, slide projections and Gerard Malanga in an S&amp;M outfit cracking a whip.  The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] is the culmination of this area of his work.

* Photography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of Polaroid camera that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. His late oeuvre contains black and white photos sewn together.

=== Product ===
In many of his efforts Warhol has taken the position of a producer or director, rather than a creator. From an artist he gradually became the person that determined the direction and was the public face of a company, having a staff of sorts to do the actual labor involved in his products. He would coin an idea and oversee its execution, his Factory evolved from an atelier into an office.

As this position proved to work out, he found himself able to expand his activities into other fields. He founded the gossip magazine Interview, creating a stage for celebrities he &quot;endorsed&quot; and creating jobs for his friends. He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground and presented them to the public as his latest interest, cooperating with them, shaping their public personas. He would produce things and people, and they were part of his artistic product. He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, made business deals and even &quot;sold&quot; the film-making branch of his company when he decided to spend less time filming himself.

In this respect Warhol talked about &quot;Art Business&quot; and &quot;Business Art&quot;, and how he thought business was the best type of art. This was a radical new stance, as artists had always presented themselves as flamboyant, individual, visionairy outsiders - commenting on the normal part of society, but never really being a part of it. And receiving appreciation for that position on basis of their idealism, rare talents and personalities. Warhol and other pop-artists helped redefine the artist's position as professional, commercial, popular; a logical and valuable part of society. He did this using methods, imagery and talents that were (or at least seemed to be) available to everyone. Perhaps that has been the most meaningful result of (his) Pop Art: a philosophical and practical incorporation of art into society, art as a product of society.

=== Museums ===
The [[Andy Warhol Museum]] is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the largest American art museum dedicated to a single artist, holding more than 4,000 works by the artist himself.

Among others, Andy's brother, John Warhola, and the Warhol Foundation in New York, established in 1991 the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art in the remote town of [[Medzilaborce]], [[Slovakia]]. Andy's mother, Julia Warhola, was born 15 kilometers away in the village of Mikova. The museum houses several originals donated mainly by the Andy Warhol Foundation in New York and also personal items donated by Warhol's relatives

'''''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted''''' was [[Ice Cube]]'s debut solo album after his acrimonious split from [[N.W.A.]].  It was originally released [[May 16]], [[1990]] (see [[1990 in music]]).

The title of the album is controversial.  It is a spoof of a television show called &quot;[[America's Most Wanted]]&quot;, wherein real-life crimes are reenacted and viewers are asked to call in if they have seen the alleged perpetrators.  The show has taken some criticism for the reenactments, which critics claim perpetuate beliefs in the criminality of [[African-American]] men and other minorities.  The [[alternative political spellings|political spelling]] of &quot;America&quot; with &quot;KKK&quot; equates both the show and the status quo of society in the [[United States]] with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a [[white supremacy|white-supremacist]] organization.

''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' is a [[gangsta rap]] album, and the songs are tales of a young black man living in the [[ghetto]] and dealing with such issues as [[drug addiction]], [[racism]] and [[poverty]].  To understand the album's statement, it is important to note the environment of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in the early 1990s.  Riots would rack the city following the [[Rodney King]] verdict, seen by many (including Ice Cube) as an example of the racism inherent in the judicial and law enforcement systems.  Also, the [[O. J. Simpson]] trial would provoke further racial tension in the country, especially Los Angeles.  Unlike many other albums from the same period, Cube did not allow the subject matter to infuse the album with inherent negativity.   He attacks perceived racist social structures, far more than many gangsta rappers were doing at the time and since.  Though he describes with detail the conditions of the ghetto, he does so in order to condemn those that allow ghetto despair to occur, instead of glorifying it.

Cube takes some controversial stands, referring to certain types of African-Americans as &quot;Oreo cookies&quot;, implying that they appear to be black but are actually willing participants in the racial hierarchy that keeps the majority of African-Americans living in poverty-stricken and drug-riddled ghettos; specifically, this is aimed at soft-pop-R&amp;B radio stations broadcasting a watered-down sound.  [[Arsenio Hall]] is specifically mentioned as being such a &quot;sell-out&quot;.  The titular song on the album directly parodies the television show, &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot;, exposing the perceived racism inherent in watching largely African-American men being arrested for entertainment.

:&quot;I think back to when I was robbin' my own kind,
:the police didn't pay it no mind.
:But when I start robbin the white folks?
:Now I'm in the pen with the soap on a rope&quot;

A later song (&quot;Get Off My Dick Nigga, and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here&quot;) returns to the same theme at the end, with newscaster [[Peter Jennings]] reporting on rioting: &quot;Outside the [[South Los Angeles|south central]] area, few cared about the violence because it didn't affect them.&quot;  Also of interest is &quot;It's a Man's World&quot;, a rap-conversation with [[Yo-Yo]]; the two verbally spar and trade sexist barbs back and forth; outside of this song, the album received criticism for alleged [[sexism]], as in &quot;You Can't Fade Me&quot;, a humorous track where Cube fantasizes about kicking a former one-night stand in the stomach because she is pregnant with his baby.  &quot;Nigga You Love To Hate&quot; is also notable for a chorus chanting &quot;Fuck you, Ice Cube&quot;, setting the tone for the album and introducing a pattern of obscenity and profanity.  

Produced by [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy]]) and [[Da Lench Mob]], ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' received accolades for innovation in production upon release.  However, many critics do not feel that the beats in the album have aged very well.  Since this time, West Coast rap has largely taken a different direction from Ice Cube's style, heading more towards the smooth drawl of [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Snoop Dogg]]; this album sounds dated as a result.  

Before striking out on his own, Ice Cube was a member of the legendary West Coast rap group [[N.W.A.]] (''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' - [[1989]]). Thus, Ice Cube's lyrical style is descended from West Coast rappers like [[Ice T]] (''[[Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say]]'' - [[1989]]) and [[Too Short|Too $hort]] (''[[Life Is Too Short|Life Is...Too $hort]]'').  Musically, [[Public Enemy]] (''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' - [[1987]])'s spare, hollow beats, [[old school rap]]pers like [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]] (''[[Paid in Full]]'' - [[1987]]) and [[Kurtis Blow]] (''[[Kurtis Blow (album)|Kurtis Blow]]'' - [[1980]]) and 1970s [[funk]] ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] - ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]'' - [[1978]]; [[Gap Band]] - ''[[The Gap Band II]]'') and [[soul music|soul]] ([[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] - ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' - [[1971]]; [[Curtis Mayfield]] - ''[[Let's Do It Again]]'' - [[1975]]) influenced Ice Cube's sound, partially through his producers, [[the Bomb Squad]].

Ice Cube influenced later West Coast rappers, including the stoned drawl of [[Cypress Hill]] (''[[Cypress Hill (album)|Cypress Hill]]'' - [[1991]]) and [[The Pharcyde]] (''[[Bizarre Ride II to the Pharcyde]]'' - [[1992]]), as well as later [[G Funk]] rappers like [[Dr. Dre]] (''[[The Chronic]]'' - [[1992]]) and [[Snoop Doggy Dogg]] (''[[Doggystyle]]'' - [[1993]]).  Though Ice Cube's popularity among mainstream listeners has not continued into the late 1990s, and his sound is distinctively [[old school rap|old school]] to modern ears, many rappers themselves have been influenced by his innovative lyrical techniques.  Rappers like [[Eminem]] (''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' - [[1999]]), [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]] (''[[Illmatic]]'' - [[1994]]) and [[Tupac Shakur]] (''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' - [[1992]]) similarly use cartoonish and unrealistic images of thug violence to protest the conditions of the poor and working class.  While Ice Cube most often described true circumstances in outlandish fashion, such as a fairy tale in &quot;A Gangsta's Fairytale&quot;, later rappers took this to the extreme of describing physically impossible acts of violence in an outrageously exaggerated manner.

The album spawned the hit single soulful and depressing ''Dead Homiez'' on the charts.

'''Afrika Bambaataa''' (born [[April 10]] or [[October 4]], [[1957]] or [[1960]], though his birthdate is hotly debated; he himself refuses to comment on his age) is a DJ and community leader from the South [[Bronx]], who was instrumental in the early development of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] throughout the 1970s.

Afrika Bambaataa's birthname has been mistakenly listed as Kevin Donovan; however, Kevin Donovan was actually another man and leader of the Harlem Underground Band.

During Bambaataa's early years, he was a founding member of the Bronxdale Projects-area [[street gang]], The Savage Seven. Due to the explosive growth of the gang, it later became known as the [[Black Spades]], and Bambaataa rose to the position of Division Leader.  After a life-changing visit to Africa, he changed his name to '''Afrika Bambaataa Aasim'''. Bambaataa was influenced by the depiction of the [[Zulu]] warriors attacking British troops at Rorke's Drift in the [[Michael Caine]] film ''[[Zulu (film)|Zulu]]''.  He took his name, which roughly translated to &quot;affectionate leader&quot;, from the film.

After the visit, Bambaataa decided to use his leadership to turn those involved in the gang life into something more positive to the community. This began the development of [[The Organization]], which soon later became known as the [[Zulu Nation]], a group of racially and politically aware rappers, [[B-boy]]s, [[graffiti]] artists and other people involved in hip hop culture that gained fame in the early eighties to mid nineties.  By [[1977]], inspired by DJ [[Kool Herc]], Bambaataa had begun organizing [[block parties]] all around the South Bronx, and he was soon renowned as one of the best DJs in the business.  In [[1980]], he produced [[Soul Sonic Force]]'s landmark single, &quot;[[Zulu Nation Throwdown]]&quot;. In 2000 [[Rage Against The Machine]] covered Afrika's song Renegades of Funk for their album &quot;[[Renegades (album)|Renegades]]&quot;.

In [[1982]], Bambaataa organised the very first European hip hop tour. Along with himself were rapper and graffiti artist [[Rammellzee]], Zulu Nation DJ [[Grand Mixer DXT]] (formerly Grand Mixer D.St), B-boy and B-girl crews the [[Rock Steady Crew]], and the Double Dutch Girls, as well as legendary graffiti artists [[Fab 5 Freddy]], [[Phase 2]], [[Futura 2000]], and [[Dondi]].

Also in 1982, Bambaataa became a solo artist (having produced several other singles) and released &quot;[[Jazzy Sensation]]&quot; on [[Tommy Boy Records]] in that year.  &quot;[[Planet Rock - The Album|Planet Rock]]&quot;, a popular single, came out that June under the name Afrika Bambaataa and the [[Soul Sonic Force]].  The song melded electronic hip hop beats with the main melody from [[Kraftwerk]]'s [[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]], as well as portions from records by [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Captain Sky]] - thus creating a new style of music altogether, [[electro funk]]. It influenced many styles of [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music]], e.g. [[house music]] and [[techno music]]. In [[1984]], Bambaataa recorded &quot;[[Unity]]&quot; with [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] and released &quot;[[World Destruction]]&quot; under the name [[Time Zone]] (with [[John Lydon]]).  [[Shango Funk Theology]], a full length album, came out under the name Shango.  This was followed by &quot;[[Funk You]]&quot; in [[1985]] and then his formal full album debut, [[Beware (The Funk Is Everywhere)]].

Bambaataa then left Tommy Boy and signed with [[Capitol Records]], released [[The Light]] (as Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Family), which included aid from [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Boy George]] and [[UB40]].  [[1990-2000: Decade of Darkness]] was released in [[1991]]. It included both [[hip house]] tracks that were produced by the Italian team De Point (most of those have been collected on ZYX record's &quot;The 12&quot; Mixes&quot; Compilation) as well as hip hop and electro funk tracks. On &quot;Warlocks and Witches&quot;, Bam (as his name is often abbreviated) focused on hip hop. From the mid-1990s, Bam returned to his electro roots, collaborating with [[Westbam]] (who was named after him) and culminating in 2004's excellent album &quot;Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light&quot; which featured [[Gary Numan]] and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Alparslan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Alp Arslan'']] --&gt;

'''Muhammed ben Da'ud''' ([[1029]]–[[December 15]], [[1072]]) was the second sultan of the dynasty of [[Seljuk Turks]], in [[Iran|Persia]], and great-grandson of [[Seljuk]], the founder of the dynasty. He assumed the name of Muhammed when he embraced [[Islam]], and on account of his military prowess and personal valor and fighting skills he obtained the surname '''Alp Arslan''', which signifies &quot;a valiant lion.&quot;  

He succeeded his father [[Da'ud]] as ruler of [[Khorasan]] in [[1059]], and his uncle [[Toghrül|Toğrül]] as sultan of [[Iran]] and [[Baghdad]] in 1063, and thus became sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]]. In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[Persians|Persian]] [[vizier]], and one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  With Peace and security established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich church of [[St. Basil]] in [[Caesarea Mazaca]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]] and entered and plundered that city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which he conquered in [[1064]].

==Byzantine struggle==
In [[1068]] Alp Arslan invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] [[Romanus IV]] Diogenes, assuming the command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the first two of which were conducted by the emperor himself while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenus (great-uncle  of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus]]), the Turks were defeated in detail in [[1070]] driven across the Euphrates. In [[1071]] Romanus again took the field and advanced with 100,000 men, including a contingent of the Turkish tribe of the [[Uzes]] as well as contingents of [[France|French]] and [[Normans]], under [[Ursel of Bahol]], into [[Armenia]]. 

At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murad Tchai]], north of [[Lake Van]], he was met by Alp Arslan. The sultan proposed terms of peace, which were rejected by the emperor, and the two forces met in the [[Battle of Manzikert]], in which the Byzantines, after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed; a result due mainly to the betrayal of Romanus by his political enemies during the battle and the rapid tactics of the Turkish cavalry. 

Emperor Romanus IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. This famous conversation is recorded to have taken place after Romanus IV was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:

:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;What would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner?&quot;
:''Romanus'': &quot;Perhaps I'd kill you, or exhibit you in the streets of Constantinople.&quot;
:''Alp Arslan'': &quot;My punishment is far heavier.  I forgive you, and set you free.&quot;

Unfortunately for Romanus, the Emperor's subjects were far less kind than his enemy, making the mercy of Alp Arlsan a curse: Romanus was blinded and finally killed after great torment.

After Alp Arslan's victories the balance in the near Asia changed completely in favour of [[Seljuk Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, their victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in the [[Middle East]]. Most historians, including Edward Gibbons, date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia which had furnished the Empire with men and treasure. The importance of this battle, and the skill of Alp Arslan in fighting it, cannot be overstated. 

==State organization==
Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm, domestic affairs being handled by his Persian vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]; founder of the administrative organization which characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military fiefs, governed by Seljuk princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Persian agricultural scene.  This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedantary Persians, and other established cultures within the Seljuk realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army, without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiery.  He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.  

==Death==
The dominion of Alp Arslan after Manzikert extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march to the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was, however, obliged to surrender and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to a cruel death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan motioned to his guards not to interfere and drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died four days later from this wound on [[November 25]], [[1072]] in his 42nd year, and was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father [[Çağrı Bey]]. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription: 

:“''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold! He is under the black soil now''...”

As he lay dying, Alp Arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him.  &quot;Alas,&quot; he is recorded to have said, &quot;surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lay, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''American Film Institute''' ('''AFI''') is an independent [[non-profit]] organization created by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which was established in [[1967]] when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.  

George Stevens, Jr., was the first CEO and Director.  In 1980 [[Jean Picker Firstenberg]] became Director and CEO, a position she still holds.

The American Film Institute focuses on training through hands-on experience with established figures in the [[AFI Conservatory]], as well as on preserving old film, which is subject to degradation of its [[film stock]]. In spite of its name, AFI does not focus exclusively on [[film]], but also on [[television]] and [[video]].

In [[1973]], the AFI established a [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Life Achievement Award]]. 

In [[1998]], the 100th anniversary of American film, AFI began its [[100 Years Series]], celebrating and promoting interest in film history. 

They recently opened the [[AFI Silver]] theatre in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] near [[Washington, D.C.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''auteur theory''' is the theory that a film (or a body of work) by a director (or, rarely, a producer) reflects the personal vision and preoccupations of that director, as if he or she were the work's primary &quot;author&quot; ([[auteur]]).  The auteur theory has had a major impact on [[film criticism]] worldwide ever since it was first advocated by [[François Truffaut]] in 1954. &quot;Auteurism&quot; is the method of analyzing films based on this theory (or, alternately, the characteristics of a director's work that makes him an auteur). Both the Auteur Theory and the auteurism method of film analysis are frequently associated with the [[French New Wave]] and the film critics who wrote for the [[Cahiers du cinéma]].

''For a list of directors who are considered '''auteurs''', go to the article [[Auteur]]''.
__NOTOC__
==Truffaut's theory==

In his [[1954]] essay ''Une certaine tendance du cinéma français'' (&quot;a certain tendency in the French cinema&quot;) [[François Truffaut]] coined the phrase &quot;la politique des auteurs&quot;, and asserted that the worst of [[Jean Renoir]]'s movies would always be more interesting than the best of [[Jean Delannoy]]'s. &quot;Politique&quot; might very well be translated as &quot;policy,&quot; &quot;polemic&quot; or &quot;program&quot;; it involves a conscious decision to look at movies and to value them in a certain way. Truffaut provocatively said, &quot;There are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors.&quot; 

Much of Truffaut's writing of this period (as too that of his colleagues at the film criticism magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'') was designed to lambast post-war French cinema, and especially the big production films of the ''cinéma de qualité'' (&quot;quality films&quot;) that Truffaut's circle referred to with disdain as ''cinéma de papa'' (or &quot;Dad's cinema&quot;).  Their sudden discovery of a host of great American movies which flooded France at the end of the war (the [[Vichy France|Nazi occupation]] had prevented the French from seeing such classics as [[The Maltese Falcon]] and [[Citizen Kane]]) incited Truffaut to take up arms against what he considered to be an old-fashioned and sterile cinema.  (One of the unfortunate ironies of the auteur theory is that, at the very moment Truffaut was writing, the Hollywood [[studio system]] of the 1950's had destroyed much of what he had appreciated.) 

Truffaut's thinking was indebted to the work of [[André Bazin]], co-founder of the ''Cahiers du cinéma'' (where Truffaut worked), who promoted the idea that films should reflect a director's personal vision and who championed such filmmakers as [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Jean Renoir]].  Although Bazin provided a forum for auteurism to flourish, he himself remained wary of its excesses.

Another key element of Truffaut's theory comes from [[Alexandre Astruc]]'s notion of the ''caméra-stylo'' or &quot;camera-pen&quot; and the idea that directors should wield their cameras like writers use their pens and that they need not be hindered by traditional storytelling.

Truffaut and the members of the ''Cahiers'' recognized that moviemaking was an industrial process. However, they proposed an ideal to strive for: the director should use the commercial apparatus the way a writer uses a pen and, through the [[mise en scène]], imprint his or her vision on the work (conversely, the role of the screenwriter was minimized in their eyes). While recognizing that not all directors reached this ideal, they valued the work of those who neared it.

Truffaut's theory maintains that all good directors (and many bad ones) have such a distinctive style or consistent theme that their influence is unmistakable in the body of their work.  Truffaut himself was appreciative of both directors with a marked visual style (such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]), and those whose visual style was less pronounced but who had nevertheless a consistent theme throughout their movies (such as [[Jean Renoir]]'s humanism).

==Impact of the &quot;auteur theory&quot;==

The ''auteur theory'' was used by the directors of the ''[[nouvelle vague]]'' (New Wave) movement of French cinema in the 1960s (many of whom were also critics at the ''Cahiers du cinéma'') as justification for their intensely personal and idiosyncratic films.

The approach soon found a home in English-language film criticism. In the U.K., ''Movie'' adopted auteurism and in the U.S., [[Andrew Sarris]] introduced it in the essay, &quot;Notes on the Auteur Theory&quot; in 1962.  This essay is where the half-French, half-English term, &quot;auteur theory,&quot; originated.  To be classified as an &quot;auteur&quot;, according to Sarris, a director must accomplish technical competence in his or her technique, personal style in terms of how the movie looks and feels, and interior meaning (although many of Sarris's auterist criteria were left vague). Later in the decade, Sarris published ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions, 1929-1968'', which quickly became the unofficial bible of auteurism.

The auteurist critics&amp;mdash;[[François Truffaut|Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol|Chabrol]], [[Éric Rohmer|Rohmer]]&amp;mdash;wrote mostly about directors (as they were directors themselves), although they also produced some shrewd appreciations of actors. Later writers of the same general school have emphasized the contributions of star personalities like [[Mae West]]. However, the stress was on directors, and screenwriters, producers and others have reacted with a good deal of hostility. Writer [[William Goldman]] has said that, on first hearing the auteur theory, his reaction was, &quot;What's the punchline?&quot;

==Criticism of the &quot;auteur theory&quot;==

Starting in the 1960s, there has been a backlash against the auteur theory.  [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Andrew Sarris|Sarris]] feuded in the pages of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and various film magazines.  One reason for the backlash is the collaborative aspect of shooting a film (one person cannot do everything) and in the theory's privileging of the role of the director (whose name, at times, has become more important than the movie itself).  In [[Pauline Kael|Kael]]'s review of [[Citizen Kane]], a classic film for the auteur model, she points out how the film involved the talents of co-writer [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] and would have been hurt without their distinctive ability.  Also, the very people who championed the auteur theory backed away from it. [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] handed over much creative control to others (most notably [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]]) in his later films while, in a twist of irony, Truffaut's later films embraced the same formalism he rejected early on in his career.  Also, with costly films like [[Michael Cimino]]'s [[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]], the excesses of auteurism not only created uncreative films, they put studios out of business.

However, even with the reevaulation of auteurism, the auteur theory continues to influence new filmmakers to this day.

'''Akira Kurosawa''' (黒澤 明 ''Kurosawa Akira'', also 黒沢 明 in [[Wiktionary:Shinjitai|Shinjitai]], [[23 March]], [[1910]] &amp;ndash; [[6 September]], [[1998]]) was a prominent [[Japan|Japanese]] [[film director]], [[film producer]], and [[screenwriter]].

Few filmmakers have had a career so long or so acclaimed as Akira Kurosawa, perhaps Japan's best-known filmmaker. His films greatly influenced an entire generation of filmmakers the world over, ranging from George Lucas to Sergio Leone. 

His first credited film (''[[Sanshiro Sugata (1943 film)|Sugata Sanshiro]]'') was released in 1943; his last (''[[Madadayo]]'') in 1993. His many awards include the [[Legion d'Honneur]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lifetime Achievement. 

== Early Career ==
Kurosawa was born in [[Ota, Tokyo|Omori]], [[Tokyo]], the youngest of seven children. He trained as a painter and began work in the film industry as an assistant director to Kajiro Yamamoto in 1936. He made his directorial debut in 1943 with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata (1943 film)|Sugata Sanshiro]]''. His first few films were made under the watchful eye of the wartime Japanese government and sometimes contained nationalistic themes. For instance, ''[[The Most Beautiful|The Most Beautiful]]'' is a propaganda film about Japanese women working in an armaments factory. ''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II|Judo Saga 2]]'' has been held to be explicitly anti-American in the way that it portrays Japanese [[judo]] as superior to western (American) [[boxing]]. 

His first post-war film ''No regrets for our youth'', by contrast, is critical of the old Japanese regime and is about the wife of a left-wing dissident arrested for his political leanings. Kurosawa made several more films which deal with contemporary Japan, most notably ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ''[[Stray Dog]]''. However it was a period film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' which made him internationally famous and won the Grand Prix at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

== Characteristics ==
Kurosawa is best-known for his period pieces or {{nihongo|''[[jidaigeki]]''|時代劇|}} like ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'', but several of his films dealt with contemporary Japan: for example ''[[Stray Dog]]'', which looks at the criminal underworld just after the end of the war, and ''[[Ikiru]]'', which deals with a Japanese bureaucrat who discovers that he is suffering from cancer but eventually steps out of depression and struggles against bureacratic inertia to leave his small contribution to the world in the form of a small community park before he dies.

Kurosawa had a distinctive cinematic technique, which he had developed by the 1950s, and which gave his films a unique look. He liked using telephoto lenses for the way they flattened the frame and also because he believed that placing cameras farther away from his actors produced better performances. He also liked using multiple cameras, which allowed him to shoot an action from different angles. Another Kurosawa trademark was the use of weather elements to heighten mood: for example the heavy rain in the final battle in ''Seven Samurai'' and the fog in ''Throne of Blood''. Kurosawa also liked using left-to-right frame wipes as a transition device.

He was known as &quot;Tenno&quot;, literally &quot;Emperor&quot;, for his dictatorial directing style. He was a perfectionist who spent enormous amounts of time and effort to achieve the desired visual effects. In ''[[Rashomon]]'', he dyed the rain water black with calligraphy ink in order to achieve the effect of heavy rain, and ended up using up the entire local water supply of the location area in creating the rainstorm. In ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', in the final scene in which Mifune is shot by arrows, Kurosawa used real arrows shot by expert archers from a short range, landing within centimetres of Mifune's body. 

Other stories include demanding a stream be made to run in the opposite direction in order to get a better visual effect, and having the roof of a house removed, later to be replaced, because he felt the roof's presence to be unattractive in a short sequence filmed from a train.

== Influences ==
A notable feature of Kurosawa's films is the breadth of his artistic influences. Some of his plots are adaptations of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'' is based on ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'' is based on ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''Throne of Blood'' is based on ''[[Macbeth]]''. Kurosawa also directed film adaptations of Russian novels, including ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' by [[Dostoevsky]] and ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]]. ''Ikiru'' was based on [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''. ''[[High and Low]]'' was based on ''[[King's Ransom]]'' by [[United States|American]] [[crime]] writer [[Ed McBain]]. ''[[Stray Dog]]'' was inspired by the detective novels of [[Georges Simenon]]. The American film director [[John Ford]] also had a large influence on his work. 

Despite criticism by some Japanese critics that Kurosawa was &quot;too Western&quot;, he was deeply influenced by Japanese culture as well, including the [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]] theaters and the jidaigeki (period drama) genre of Japanese cinema.

== His influence ==
Kurosawa's films had a huge influence on world cinema. Most explicitly, ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' was remade as the [[western movie|western]] ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', and Pixar's ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. It also inspired two [[Hindi films]], [[Ramesh Sippy]]'s ''[[Sholay]]'' and Rajkumar Santhoshi's ''[[China Gate]]'', with similar plots. The story has also inspired [[novel]]s, among them [[Stephen King]]'s fifth ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' novel, ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. 

''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''  was the basis for the [[Sergio Leone]] western ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[Miller's Crossing (film)|Miller's Crossing]]'', and the [[Bruce Willis]] prohibition-era ''[[Last Man Standing (film)|Last Man Standing]]''. 

''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' had an influence on [[George Lucas]]'s earliest ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, especially in the characters of R2-D2 and C3PO.

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' not only helped open Japanese cinema to the world but virtually entered the English language as a term for fractured, inconsistent narratives as well as influencing other works, including episodes of television series and many motion pictures.

== Collaboration ==
During his most productive period, from the late 40s to the mid-60s, Kurosawa often worked with the same group of collaborators. [[Fumio Hayasaka]] composed music for seven of his films; notably ''Rashomon'', ''Ikiru'' and ''Seven Samurai''. Many of Kurosawa's scripts, including ''Throne of Blood'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran'' were co-written with [[Hideo Oguni]]. [[Yoshiro Muraki]] was Kurosawa's [[production designer]] or [[art director]] for most of his films after ''Stray Dog'' in 1949 and [[Asakazu Naki]] was his [[cinematographer]] on 11 films including ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran''. Kurosawa also liked recycling the same group of actors, especially [[Takashi Shimura]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]]. His collaboration with the latter is one of the greatest director-actor combinations in cinema history. It began with 1948's ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ended with 1964's ''[[Red Beard]]''.

== Later films ==
Red Beard marked a turning point in Kurosawa's career in more ways than one. In addition to being his last film with Mifune, it was his last in black-and-white. It was also his last as a major director within the Japanese studio system making roughly a film a year.  Kurosawa was signed to direct a Hollywood project, ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''; but [[20th Century Fox]] replaced him with [[Kinji Fukasaku]] before it was completed.  His next few films were a lot harder to finance and were made at intervals of five years. The first, ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', about a group of poor people living around a rubbish dump, was not a success. 

After an attempted suicide, Kurosawa went on to make several more films although arranging domestic financing was highly difficult despite his international reputation. ''[[Dersu Uzala]]'', made in the [[Soviet Union]] and set in Siberia in the early 20th century, was the only Kurosawa film made outside Japan and not in Japanese. It is about the friendship of a Russian explorer and a nomadic hunter. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]] for Best Foreign Language Film. ''[[Kagemusha]]'', financed with the help of the director's most famous admirers, [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]], is the story of a man who is the double of a medieval Japanese lord and takes over his identity. Most important was ''[[Ran (1985 film)|Ran]]'', Kurosawa's version of King Lear set in medieval Japan. It was the great project of Kurosawa's late career, and he spent a decade planning it and trying to obtain funding, which he was finally able to do with the help of the French producer Serge Silberman. The film was a phenomenal international success and is generally considered Kurosawa's last masterpiece.

Kurosawa made three more films during the 1990s which were more personal than his earlier works. ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' is a series of vignettes based on his own dreams. ''[[Rhapsody in August]]'' is about memories of the [[Nagasaki]] atom bomb and his final film: ''[[Madadayo]]'' is about a retired teacher and his former students. Kurosawa died in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], at age 88.

==Trivia==

Kurosawa was a notoriously lavish gourmet, and spent huge quantities of money on film sets providing an uneatably large quantity and quality  of delicacies, especially meat, for the cast and crew.

'''Ancient Egypt''' was a [[civilization]] located along the Lower [[Nile]], reaching from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north to as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the time of its greatest extension (15th century BC). It lasted for three [[millennia]], from ''circa'' [[3200 BC]] to [[343 BC]], ending when [[Artaxerxes III]] conquered [[Egypt]].  As a civilization based on [[irrigation]] it is the quintessential example of a [[hydraulic empire]].[[Image:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg |thumb|right|450px|[[Khafre's Pyramid]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]) and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (c.[[2600 BC]] or perhaps earlier)]]

==Background==
[[Image:Map Ancient Egypt.png|thumb|right|275px|Map of Ancient Egypt]]Egypt is a [[transcontinental nation]] located mostly in [[North Africa]], with the [[Sinai Peninsula]] lying in [[Asia]]. The country has shorelines on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. It borders [[Libya]] to the west; [[Sudan]] to the south; and the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Israel]] to the east. Ancient Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, known as [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The [[Nile]] river flows northward from a southerly point to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The Nile river, around which much of the population of the country clusters, has been the lifeline for Egyptian culture since the [[Stone Age]] and [[Naqada]] cultures.

The area around the Nile was called Kemet (&quot;the black land&quot;, in [[Ancient Egyptian]] ''Kmt''), the name for the dark soil deposited by the Nile floodwaters. In contrast, the desert was called Deshret (&quot;the red land&quot;, in [[Ancient Egyptian]] ''Dsrt''), c.f. [[Herodotus]]: &quot;Egypt is a land of black soil.... We know that [[Libya]] is a redder earth&quot; (Histories, 2:12). The vowels within the consonants K-M-T are not known with certainty. [[Coptic language|Coptic]], however, provides some indication.

Nomadic hunter-gatherers began living along the Nile during the [[Pleistocene]]. Traces of these early peoples appear in the form of artifacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the Nile and in the oases. By about 6000 B.C., organized agriculture and large building construction had appeared in the Nile Valley.

==People==
Many theories have been proposed regarding the origins of early Egyptians, a subject still imbued with controversy today.  [[Controversy over race of Ancient Egyptians]] has more information about this subject.

Egyptian society was a merging of [[Berbers|North]] and [[Northeast Africa]]n as well as [[Southwest Asia]]n peoples. Modern [[genetic genealogy|genetics]] reveals {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.348}} {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.349}} that the Egyptian population today is characterized by [[Haplogroup#Y chromosome DNA haplogroups|paternal]] lineages common to [[Berbers|North Africans]] primarily, and to some [[Near East]]ern peoples. Studies based on the [[Haplogroup#Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups|maternal]] lineages closely links modern Egyptians with people from modern [[Ethiopia]] {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.350}}, {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.351}}. The ancient Egyptians themselves traced their origin to a land they called [[Land of Punt|Punt]], or &quot;Ta Nteru&quot; (&quot;Land of the Gods&quot;), which most Egyptologists locate in the area encompassing the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].

A recent bioanthropological study on the dental morphology of ancient Egyptians confirms dental traits most characteristic of [[Berbers|North African]] and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n populations. The study also establishes biological continuity from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] to the post-pharaonic periods. Among the samples included is skeletal material from the [[Gallery of Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which was found to most closely resemble the [[Badarian]] series of the predynastic {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.352}}, {{ref|www.world-science.net.353}}. A study based on stature and body proportions suggests that [[Nilotic]] or tropical body characteristics were also present in some later groups {{ref|Zakrzewski}} as the Egyptian empire expanded southward.

[[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion the Younger]], who deciphered the [[Rosetta Stone]], claimed in ''Expressions et Termes Particuliers'' that ''kmt'' referred to a 'negroid' population. Modern day professional Egyptologists, anthropologists, and linguists, however, overwhelmingly agree that the term referred to the dark soil of the Nile Valley rather than the people, which contrasted with ''dSrt'' or the &quot;red land&quot; of the [[Sahara]] desert.

In c. 450 BC, [[Herodotus]] wrote, &quot;the Colchians are Egyptians... on the fact that they are swarthy (''melanchrôs'') and wooly-haired (''oulothrix'')&quot; (Histories Book 2:104). ''Melanchros'' was also used by [[Homer]] to describe the sunburnt complexion of [[Odysseus]] (Od. 16.176). 

Although analyzing the hair of ancient Egyptian [[Mummy|mummies]] from the Late [[Middle Kingdom]] has revealed evidence of a stable diet {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.354}}, mummies from circa [[3200 BC]] show signs of severe [[anemia]] and [[Hematology|hemolitic disorders]] {{ref|www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.355}}. [[Image:Memnon2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Colossus]] of [[Memnon]].]]

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of ancient Egypt]]''
Egyptian culture was remarkably stable and changed little over a period of nearly 3000 years. This includes religion, customs, art expression, architecture and social structure.

The [[history of ancient Egypt]] proper starts with Egypt as a unified state, which occurred sometime around [[3000 BC]]. [[Narmer]], who unified Upper and Lower Egypt, was the first [[pharaoh]]; though [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian [[society]] existed for a much longer period (see [[Predynastic Egypt]]).

Along the [[Nile]], in [[10th millennium BC]], a [[cereal|grain]]-[[grinding]] [[culture]] using the earliest type of [[sickle]] [[blade]]s had been replaced by another culture of [[hunting|hunters]], [[fishing|fishers]], and [[hunter-gatherer|gathering]] peoples using [[stone tool]]s. Evidence also indicates human habitation in the southwestern corner of Egypt, near the [[Sudan]] border, before [[8000 BC]]. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around [[8th millennium BC|8000 BC]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of [[Egypt]], eventually forming the [[Sahara]] (c.[[2500 BC]]), and early tribes naturally migrated to the Nile river where they developed a settled [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralized [[society]] (see [[Nile#History|Nile: History]]). There is evidence of [[pastoralism]] and cultivation of [[cereal]]s in the East [[Sahara]] in the [[7th millennium BC]]. By [[6000 BC]] ancient Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were [[herding]] cattle and [[construction|constructing]] large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)]] was in use by [[4000 BC]]. The [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] continues through this time, variously held to begin with the [[Naqada]] culture. Some authorities however begin the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] earlier, in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (see [[Predynastic Egypt]]).

Egypt unified as a single state circa [[3000 BC]]. [[Egyptian chronology]] involves assigning beginnings and endings to various dynasties beginning around this time. The [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] is the accepted developments during the 20th century, but do not include any of the major revision proposals that have also been made in that time. Even within a single work, often archeologists will offer several possible dates or even several whole chronologies as possibilities. Consequently, there may be discrepancies between dates shown here and in articles on particular rulers. Often there are also several possible spellings of the names. Typically, Egyptologists divide the history of pharaonic civilization using a schedule laid out first by [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptaica''.

=== Taxation ===
The Egyptian government imposed a number of different taxes upon its people. As there was no known form of currency during that time period, taxes were paid for &quot;in kind&quot; (with produce or work). The Vizier controlled the taxation system through the departments of state. The departments had to report daily on the amount of stock availible, and how much was expected in the future. Taxes were paid for depending on a persons craft or duty. Landowners paid their taxes in grain and other produce grown on their property. Craftsmen paid their taxes in the goods that they produced. Hunters and fishermen paid their taxes with produce from the river, marshes, and desert. One person from every household was required to pay a labor tax by doing public work for a few weeks every year, such as digging canals or mining. However, a richer noble could hire a poorer man to do his labor tax.

==Language==
{{main|Egyptian language}}
Ancient Egyptian constitutes an independent branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language [[phylum (linguistics)|phylum]]. Its closest relatives are the [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and [[Beja language|Beja]] groups of languages. Written records of the [[Egyptian language]] have been dated from about [[32nd century BC|3200 BC]], making it one of the oldest and longest documented languages. Scholars group Egyptian into six major chronological divisions:
*'''[[Archaic Egyptian]]''' (before 3000 BC)
:Consists of inscriptions from the late [[Predynastic Period|Predynastic]] and [[Early Dynastic Period|Early Dynastic]] period. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian [[hieroglyphic]] writing appears on [[Naqada]] II pottery vessels.
*'''[[Old Egyptian]]''' (3000&amp;ndash;2000 BC)
:The language of the [[Old Kingdom]] and [[First Intermediate Period]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] are the largest body of literature written in this phase of the language. Tomb walls of elite Egyptians from this period also bear autobiographical writings representing Old Egyptian. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the tripling of [[ideogram]]s, phonograms, and determinatives to indicate the plural. Overall, it does not differ significantly from the next stage.
*'''[[Middle Egyptian]]''' (2000&amp;ndash;1300 BC)
:Often dubbed '''Classical Egyptian''', this stage is known from a variety of textual evidence in [[hieroglyphic]] and [[hieratic]] scripts dated from about the [[Middle Kingdom]]. It includes funerary texts inscribed on [[sarcophagi]] such as the [[Coffin Texts]]; wisdom texts instructing people on how to lead a life that exemplified the ancient Egyptian philosophical worldview (see the [[Ipuwer papyrus]]); tales detailing the adventures of a certain individual, for example the [[The Story of Sinuhe|Story of Sinhue]]; medical and scientific texts such as the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] and the [[Ebers papyrus]]; and poetic texts praising a god or a [[pharaoh]], like the [[Hymn to the Nile]]. The Egyptian [[vernacular]] already began to change from the written language as evidenced by some Middle Kingdom hieratic texts, but classical Middle Egyptian continued to be written in formal contexts well into the Late Dynastic period (sometimes referred to as [[Late Middle Egyptian]]).
*'''[[Late Egyptian]]''' (1300&amp;ndash;700 BC)
:Records of this stage appear in the second part of the [[New Kingdom]], considered by many as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of ancient Egyptian civilization. It contains a rich body of religious and secular literature, comprising such famous examples as the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instructions of Ani]]. It was also the language of [[Ramesside]] administration. Late Egyptian is not totally distinct from Middle Egyptian, as many &quot;classicisms&quot; appear in historical and literary documents of this phase. However, the difference between Middle and Late Egyptian is greater than that between Middle and Old Egyptian. It's also a better representative than Middle Egyptian of the spoken language in the New Kingdom and beyond. Hieroglyphic [[orthography]] saw an enormous expansion of its [[grapheme|graphemic]] inventory between the Late Dynastic and [[Ptolemaic]] periods.
*'''[[Demotic Egyptian]]''' (7th century BC&amp;ndash;4th century AD)
{{main|Demotic Egyptian}}
*'''[[Coptic language|Coptic]]''' (3rd&amp;ndash;17th century AD)
{{main|Coptic language}}

===Writing===
For many years, the earliest known hieroglyphic inscription was the [[Narmer Palette]], found during excavations at [[Hierakonpolis]] (modern Kawm al-Ahmar) in the [[1890s]], which has been dated to c.[[3200 BC]]. However recent [[Archaeology|archaeological]] findings reveal that symbols on [[Gerzean]] pottery, ''c.''[[4000 BC]], resemble the traditional hieroglyph forms {{ref|www.touregypt.net.356}}. Also in 1998 a German archeological team under [[Gunter Dreyer]] excavating at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (modern [[Umm el-Qa'ab]]) uncovered tomb [[U-j]], which belonged to a [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] ruler, and they recovered three hundred clay labels inscribed with [[proto-hieroglyphics]] dating to the [[Naqada IIIA]] period, circa [[33rd century BC]] {{ref|www.exn.ca.357}}, {{ref|www.findarticles.com.358}}. 

Egyptologists refer to Egyptian writing as '''[[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]]s''', today standing as the world's earliest known [[writing system]].  The hieroglyphic script was partly [[syllabic]], partly [[ideographic]]. '''[[Hieratic]]''' is a cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs and was first used during the First Dynasty (c. 2925 BC &amp;ndash; c. 2775 BC). The term '''[[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]]''', in the context of Egypt, came to refer to both the script and the language that followed the Late Ancient Egyptian stage, i.e. from the [[Nubian]] [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] until its marginalization by the Greek [[Koine]] in the early centuries AD. After the conquest of [[Amr ibn al-A'as]] in the 7th century AD, the [[Coptic language]] survived as a spoken language into the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, it continues to be the liturgical language of the [[Christian]] minority.

Beginning from around [[2700 BC]], Egyptians used [[pictogram]]s to represent [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|vocal sounds]] -- both [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] vocalizations (see [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|Hieroglyph: Script]]). By [[2000 BC]], 26 [[pictogram]]s were being used to represent 24 (known) main [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|vocal sounds]]. The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] (c. [[1800 BC]]) is only an [[abjad]] system and was derived from these [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|uniliteral signs]] as well as other [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s.

The hieroglyphic script finally fell out of use around the [[4th century]] AD. Attempts to decipher it began after the [[15th century]] (see ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'').

==Culture==
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
The Egyptian religions, embodied in [[Egyptian mythology]], were a succession of beliefs held by the people of Egypt, as early as [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] times and all the way until the coming of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] in the [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Graeco-Roman]] era.  These were conducted by Egyptian [[priest]]s or [[magician]]s, but the use of [[magic and religion|magic]] and [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s is questioned.

Every animal portrayed and worshipped in ancient Egyptian art, writing and religion is indigenous to [[Africa]], all the way from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] until the [[History of Greek and Roman Egypt|Graeco-Roman]] eras, over 3000 years.  The [[Dromedary]], [[Domestication|domesticated]] first in [[Arabia]], first appears in Egypt (and North Africa) beginning in the 2nd millennium BCE.

The religious nature of ancient Egyptian civilization influenced its contribution to the [[arts of the ancient world]]. Many of the great works of ancient Egypt depict gods, goddesses, and pharaohs, who were also considered divine. [[Ancient Egyptian art]] in general is characterized by the idea of order. 

Evidence of [[Mummy#Mummies in other civilizations|mummies]] and [[Pyramid#Structures|pyramids outside ancient Egypt]] indicate reflections of ancient Egyptian belief values on other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures, transmitted in one way over the [[Silk Road]]. Ancient Egypt's [[Foreign contacts of Ancient Egypt|foreign contacts]] included [[Nubia]] and [[Punt]] to the south, the [[Aegean]] and [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greece]] to the north, the [[Levant]] and other regions in the [[Near East]] to the east, and also [[Libya]] to the west.

Some scholars have speculated that Egypt's art pieces are sexually [[Symbolism|symbolic]].

==Ancient achievements==
[[image:Egypte louvre 316.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Louvre Museum]] antiquity]]
See [[Predynastic Egypt]] for inventions and other significant achievements in the [[Civilization#Sahara Region|Sahara region]] before the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|Protodynastic Period]]. 

The art and science of [[engineering]] was present in Egypt, such as accurately determining the position of points and the distances between them (known as [[surveying]]). These skills were used to outline [[pyramid]] bases. The [[Egyptian pyramids]] took the geometric shape formed from a polygonal base and a point, called the apex, by triangular faces. [[Cement|Hydraulic Cement]]  was first invented by the Egyptians. The [[Al Fayyum]] [[Irrigation]] (water works) was one of the main agricultural breadbaskets of the ancient world. There is evidence of ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] using the natural lake of the Fayyum as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons. From the time of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First dynasty]] or before, the Egyptians [[Mining|mined]] [[turquoise]] in [[Sinai Peninsula]].

The earliest evidence (circa [[1600 BC]]) of traditional [[empiricism]] is credited to Egypt, as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers papyrus|Ebers papyri]]. The roots of the [[Scientific method#History|Scientific method]] may be traced back to the ancient Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians are also credited with devising the world's earliest known [[alphabet]], [[decimal system]] {{ref|www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk.360}} and complex [[Timeline of mathematics|mathematical formularizations]], in the form of the [[Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri]]. An awareness of the [[golden ratio]] seems to be reflected in many constructions, such as the [[Egyptian pyramids]]. 

The art of glass making is of very ancient origin with the Egyptians, as is evident from the glass jars, figures and ornaments discovered in the tombs. The paintings on the tombs have been interpreted as descriptive of the process of glass blowing. These illustrations representing smiths blowing
their fires by means of reeds tipped with clay. Therefore it can be concluded that glass-blowing is apparently of Egyptian origin.

===Open problems===
{{main|Unsolved problems in Egyptology}}

There is a question as to the sophistication of ancient Egyptian technology, and there are several [[open problem]]s concerning real and alleged ancient Egyptian achievements. Certain artifacts and records do not fit with conventional technological development systems. It is not known why there is no neat progression to an Egyptian [[Iron Age]] nor why the historical record shows the Egyptians taking so long to begin using [[iron]]. It is unknown how the Egyptians shaped and worked [[granite]]. The exact date the Egyptians started producing [[glass]] is debated.

Some question whether the Egyptians were capable of long distance [[navigation]] in their [[boat]]s and when they became knowledgeable sailors. It is contentiously disputed as to whether or not the Egyptians had some understanding of [[electricity]] and if the Egyptians used [[engine]]s or [[Baghdad Battery|batteries]]. The [[Dendera light|relief at Dendera]] is interpreted in various ways by scholars. The topic of the [[Saqqara Bird]] is controversial, as is the extent of the Egyptians' understanding of [[aerodynamics]]. It is unknown for certain if the Egyptians had [[kite]]s or [[glider]]s.

[[Beekeeping]] is known to have been particularly well developed in Egypt, as accounts are given by several [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers &amp;mdash; [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Columella]]. It is unknown whether Egyptian [[beekeeping]] developed independently or as an [[import]] from [[Southern Asia]].

The '''''motor neurone diseases''''' (MND) are a group of progressive neurological disorders that destroy [[motor neuron]]s, the cells that control voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing.  [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), sometimes called [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease, [[progressive muscular atrophy]] (PMA), [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA), progressive or pseudo-bulbar palsy (PBP) and [[primary lateral sclerosis]] (PLS) are all forms of motor neurone disease.

==Terminology==
In this article, MND refers to a group of diseases which affect the motor neurons. In the [[United States]], the term [[ALS]] is more commonly used, where it is also known as [[Lou Gehrig|Lou Gehrig's]] disease, after the [[baseball]] player. Although previously described by other neurologists of the 19th century, it was [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], a [[France|French]] [[neurologist]], who suggested grouping together a number of disparate conditions all affecting the lateral horn of the spinal cord in [[1869]]. In France the disease is sometimes known as Maladie de Charcot (Charcot's disease), although it may also be referred to by the direct translation of ALS, Sclerose Laterale Amyotrophique (SLA). To help prevent confusion, the annual scientific research conference dedicated to the study of MND is called the International ALS/MND Symposium.

==Signs and symptoms==
Neurological examination presents specific signs associated with upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Signs of [[upper motor neuron]] damage include [[spasticity]], brisk [[reflex action|reflexes]] and the [[Babinski sign]]. Signs of [[lower motor neuron]] damage include weakness and muscle atrophy. 

Note that every muscle group in the body requires both upper and lower motor neurons to function. It is a common misconception that &quot;upper&quot; motor neurons control the arms, whilst &quot;lower&quot; motor neurons control the legs. The signs described above can occur in any muscle group, including the arms, legs, torso, and bulbar region. 

Symptoms usually present between the ages of 50-70, and include progressive weakness, muscle wasting, and muscle fasciculations; spasticity or stiffness in the arms and legs; and overactive tendon reflexes. Patients may present with symptoms as diverse as a dragging foot, unilateral muscle wasting in the hands, or slurred speech. 

The symptoms described above may resemble a number of other rare diseases, known as &quot;MND Mimic Disorders&quot;. These include, but are not limited to [[multifocal motor neuropathy]], [[kennedy's disease]], [[hereditary spastic paraplegia]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and [[monomelic amyotrophy]]. A small subset of familial MND cases occur in children, such as &quot;juvenile ALS&quot;, Madras syndrome, and individuals who have inherited the ALS2 gene. However, these are not typically referred to as MND, but by their specific names.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of MND is a clinical one, established by a neurologist on the basis of history and neurological examination. There is no diagnostic test for MND. Investigations such as blood tests, [[electromyography]] (EMG), [[magnetic resonance imaging]]  (MRI), and sometmies [[genetic testing]] are useful to rule out other disorders that may mimic MND. However, the diagnosis of MND remains a clinical one. Having excluded other diseases, a relatively rapid progression of symptoms is a strong diagnostic factor. Although an individual's progression may sometimes &quot;plateau&quot;, it will not recover or slow down. A set of diagnostic criteria called the El Escorial criteria have been defined by the World Federation of Neurologists for use in research, particularly as inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials. Due to a lack of clincial diagnostic criteria, some neurologists use the El Escorial criteria during the diagnostic process, although strictly speaking this is [[functionality creep]].

MND in the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration is ALS. Where the illness affects only the upper motor neurons it is PLS, and where it affects only the lower motor neurons it is PMA. Progressive bulbar palsy is degneration of the lower motor neurons innervating the bulbar region (mouth, face, and throat), whilst pseudobulbar palsy refers to degeneration of the upper motor neurons to the same region.

==Prognosis==
Most cases of MND progess quite quickly, with noticeable decline occuring over the course of months. Although symptoms may present in one region, they will typically spread. If restricted to one side of the body they are more likely to progress to the same region on the other side of the body before progressing to a new region. After several years, most patients require help to carry out activities of daily living such as self care, feeding, and transportation. 

MND is typically fatal within 2-5 years. Around 50% die within 14 months of diagnosis. The remaining 50% will not necessarily die within the next 14 months as the distribution is significantly skewed. As a rough estimate, 1 in 5 patients survive for 5 years, and 1 in 10 patients survive 10 years. [[Stephen Hawking]] is a well-known example of a person with MND, and has lived for more than 40 years with the disease. 

Mortality results when the muscles that control breathing are no longer able to expel carbon dioxide. One exception is PLS, which may last for upwards of 25 years. Given the typical age of onset, this effectively leaves most PLS patients with a normal life span. PLS can progress to ALS, decades later.

==Pathology==
===Causes===
About 90% of cases of MND are &quot;sporadic&quot;, meaning that the patient has no family history of ALS and the case appears to have occurred with no known cause. Genetic factors are suspected to be important in determining an individual's susceptibility to disease, and there is some weak evidence to suggest that onset can be &quot;triggered&quot; by as yet unknown environmental factors (see 'Epidemiology' below). 
 
Approximately 10% of cases are &quot;familial MND&quot;, defined either by a family history of MND or by testing positive for a known genetic mutation associated with the disease. The following genes are known to be linked to ALS: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase ''SOD1'', ''ALS2'', ''NEFH''(a small number of cases), senataxin (SETX) and vesicle associated protein B (''VAPB'').

Of these, SOD1 mutations account for some 20% of familial MND cases. The ''SOD1'' gene codes for the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] scavenger that reduces the [[oxidative stress]] of cells throughout the body. So far over 100 different mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found, all of which cause some form of ALS([http://www.alsod.org ALSOD database]). In North America, the most commonly occurring mutation is known as A4V and occurs in up to 50% of SOD1 cases. In people of [[Scandinavia]]n extraction there is a relatively benign mutation called D90A which is associated with a slow progression. Future research is concentrating on identifying new genetic mutations and the clinical syndrome associated with them. Familial MND may also confer a higher risk of developing cognitive changes such as frontotemporal dementia or executive dysfunction (see 'extra-motor change in MND' below).

It is thought that ''SOD1'' mutations confer a toxic gain, rather than a loss, of function to the enzyme. SOD1 mutations may increase the propensity for the enzyme to form protein aggregates which are toxic to nerve cells.

===Pathophysiology===
[[Skeletal muscle]]s are innervated by a group of neurons (''lower motor neurons'') located on the ventral surface of the spinal cord which project to the muscle cells. These nerve cells are themselves innervated by the corticospinal tract or ''upper motor neurons'' that project from the [[motor cortex]] of the brain. On macroscopic pathology, there is a degeneration of the ventral horns of the spinal cord, as well as atrophy of the ventral roots. In the brain, atrophy may be present in the frontal and temporal lobes. On microscopic examination, neurones may show spongiosis, the presence of astrocytes, and a number of inclusions including characteristic &quot;skein-like&quot; inclusions, bunina bodies, and vacuolisation. 

There is a role in excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, presumably secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction. In animal models, death by [[apoptosis]] has also been identified.

==Emotional lability / pseudobulbar affect==
{{main|labile affect}}

Around a third of all MND patients experiece [[labile affect]], also known as emotional lability, pseudobulbar affect, or pathological laughter and crying. Patients with pseudobulbar palsy are particuarly likely to be affected, as are patients with PLS. 

==Extra-motor change in MND==
[[Cognitive]] change can and does occur in between 33&amp;ndash;50% of patients. A small proportion exhibit a form of [[frontotemporal dementia]] characterised by behavioural abnormalities such as [[disinhibition]], [[apathy]], and personality changes. A small proportion of patients may also suffer from an [[aphasia]], which causes difficulty in naming specific objects. A larger proportion (up to 50%) suffer from a milder version of cognitive change which primarily affects what is known as [[executive function]]. Briefly, this is the ability of an individual to initiate, inhibit, sustain, and switch attention and is involved in the organisation of complex tasks down to smaller components. Often patients with such changes find themselves unable to do the family finances or drive a car. [[clinical depression|Depression]] is surprisingly rare in MND (around 5&amp;ndash;20%) relative to the frequency with which it is found in other, less severe, neurological disorders e.g. ~50% in [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], ~20% in Epilepsy.  Depression does not necessarily increase as the symptoms progress, and in fact many patients report being happy with their [[quality of life]] despite profound disability.  This may reflect the use of [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] such as reevaluating what is important in life.

Although traditionally thought only to affect the motor system, sensory abnormalities are not necessarily absent, with some patients finding altered sensation to touch and heat, found in around 10% of patients. Patients with a predominantly upper motor neurone syndrome, and particularly PLS, often report an enhanced startle reflex to loud noises.

Neuroimaging and neuropathology has demonstrated extra-motor changes in the frontal lobes including the inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal gyrus. The degree of pathology in these areas has been directly related to the degree of cognitive change experienced by the patient, if any. Patients with MND and dementia have been shown to exhibit marked frontotemporal lobe atrophy as revealed by [[MRI]] or [[SPECT]] [[neuroimaging]].

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of MND is approximately 1&amp;ndash;5 out of 100,000 people. Men have a slightly higher incidence rate than women. Approximately 5,600 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. By far the greatest risk factor is age, with symptoms typically presenting between the ages of 50-70. Cases under the age of 50 years are called &quot;young onset MND&quot;, whilst incidence rates appear to tail off after the age of 85. 

Tentative environmental risk factors identified so far include: exposure to severe electrical shock leading to coma, having served in the first [[Gulf War]], and playing professional [[football (soccer)]]. However, these findings have not been firmly identified and more research is needed. 

There are three &quot;hot spots&quot; of MND in the world. One is in the Kii pensinula of Japan, one amongst a tribal population in Papua New Guinea. Until the 1960s, Chamorro inhabitants from the island of [[Guam]] in the [[Oceania|Pacific Ocean]] had an increased risk of developing a form of MND known as Guamanian ALS-PD-dementia complex or &quot;lytico bodig&quot;, but since then the incidence rates have returned to near normal, and nobody born since 1940 has developed the disease. Putative theories involve neurotoxins in local wildlife including [[cycad]] nuts and other traditional foodstuffs[http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2003/12/09/flying_fox_linked_to_disease/].

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no cure for ALS.  The only drug that affects the course of the disease is [[riluzole]]. The drug functions by blocking the effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and is thought to extend the lifespan of an ALS patient by only a few months.  

The lack of effective medications to slow the progression of ALS does not mean that patients with ALS cannot be medically cared for. Instead, treatment of patients with ALS focuses on the relief of symptoms associated with the disease. This involves a variety of health professionals including neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, respiratory therapists, social workers, palliative care specialists, specialist nurses and psychologists.  A list of neurology clinics that specialize in the care of patients with ALS can be found on the World Federation of Neurology website (http://www.wfnals.org/clinics/).

==Research Efforts==
The search for a drug that will slow ALS disease progression is underway. For example, recent research using mouse models suggests that [[minocycline]], a common antibiotic, may also be effective in extending the lifespan of ALS sufferers.  This drug must pass [[clinical trials]] with ALS patients before it may be used as a general treatment for ALS.   

[[Minocycline]] extends the lifespan of ALS mice with SOD1 mutations, but it does not prevent their eventual death. Other agents that are currently in trials include ceftriaxone, arimoclomol, IGF-1 and coenzyme Q10 to name but a few. A list of US-based clinical ALS trials may be found at www.clinicaltrials.org or by contacting your local ALS/MND charity.

==Etymology==
''Amyotrophic'' comes from the [[Greek language]]: ''A-'' means &quot;no&quot;, ''myo'' refers to &quot;muscle&quot;, and ''trophic'' means &quot;nourishment&quot;; ''amyotrophic'' therefore means &quot;no muscle nourishment,&quot; which describes the characteristic [[atrophy|atrophication]] of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. ''Lateral'' identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that are affected are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening (&quot;[[sclerosis]]&quot;) in the region.

==History and prominent patients==
[[United States|U.S.]] baseball player [[Lou Gehrig]] brought national and international attention to the disease in [[1939]] when he abruptly retired after being diagnosed with ALS/MND; he would die two years later. Former guitar virtuoso [[Jason Becker]], [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]], and ex-[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] [[Football (soccer)|football]] player [[Jimmy Johnstone]] also suffer from the disease. 

Founder of care homes [[Leonard Cheshire]] VC, owner from 1957-1966 of [[Athelhampton]] House in Dorset Sir Robert Cooke F.R.C.S., [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Victor Emery]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] [[football (soccer)|football]]er [[Sam English]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[pitcher]] [[Catfish Hunter|Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Hunter]], [[blues]] singer and guitarist [[Leadbelly]], [[China|Chinese]] Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], [[jazz]] giant [[Charles Mingus]], [[Hollywood]] actor [[David Niven]], legendary [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Don Revie]], teacher and book subject [[Morrie Schwartz]], American television actor [[Lane Smith]], linguist [[Larry Trask]], ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Jill Tweedie]], avant-garde guitarist [[Derek Bailey]], American [[soap opera]] veteran [[Michael Zaslow]], and libertarian writer, politician, and investment analyst, [[Harry Browne]] died from the disease.

[[Diane Pretty]] was a British woman with the disease who was involved in a prominent [[right-to-die]] case in the early [[2000s]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the traditional ordering of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, see [[Abjadi order]], [[Abjad numerals]].''

An '''abjad''' is a type of [[writing system]] in which there is one symbol per [[consonant|consonantal]] [[phoneme]], sometimes also called a '''consonantary'''. Abjads differ from [[alphabet|alphabets]], in that in an abjad, each basic [[grapheme]] represents a consonant, although [[vowel]]s may be indicated by [[vowel mark]]s on the basic graphemes. An alphabet has basic graphemes for both consonants and vowels. Abjads also differ from [[abugida|abugidas]]. In an abjad, each basic grapheme represents only a consonant. In an abugida, each basic grapheme represents a syllable consisting of a consonant and a vowel; the same consonant with a different vowel -- or with no vowel -- is represented by a modified or marked form of the same basic grapheme.

==Etymology==
The system takes its name from the first nonsense 'word' of the mnemonic sequence for the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in the older [[Arabic alphabet#Abjadi order|abjadi order]]. It has been suggested that the word 'Abjad' may have earlier roots in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] or [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]].

==History==
All known abjads belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original Northern Linear Abjad. The reason for this is that [[Semitic languages]] have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphemic structure]] which makes the denotation of vowels redundant or unnecessary in most cases.

==Impure abjads==
&quot;Impure&quot; abjads (such as Arabic) may have characters for some vowels as well (called ''matres lectionis'', 'mothers of reading', singular [[ mater lectionis]]), or optional vowel diacritics, or both; however, the term's originator, [[Peter T. Daniels]], insists that it should be applied only to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators, thus excluding [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. 

Impure abjads develop when, due to [[phonetics|phonetic]] change, a previous [[consonant]] or [[diphthong]] becomes a vowel. Later generations, who receive their [[orthography]] without knowing that letter originally signified a consonant there, understand it to mean a [[vowel]] as it is in their spoken language. They then use that letter as a vowel in other places where it was never a consonant. For example, the Hebrew word הורישׁ probably underwent the following pronunciation change: {{unicode|*hi'''w'''riʃ}} → {{unicode|*ho'''w'''riʃ}} → {{unicode|h'''o'''riʃ}}. The ו, which was originally the consonant w, became the vowel o. Later, probably in the [[Second Temple]] period, the vowel use of ו was expanded to places where no consonant ever existed.

===Addition of vowels===
Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full [[alphabet]]s.  This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language, the most famous case being the derivation of the [[Greek alphabet]] from the Phoenician abjad. The Greeks did not need the letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] (&amp;#1488;, &amp;#1492;, &amp;#1495;, &amp;#1506;) and [[co-articulated consonant|co-articulated]] (&amp;#1510;, &amp;#1511;) consonants. They dropped some of them and turned others into vowels.

In other cases, the vowel signs come in the form of little points or hooks attached to the consonant letters, producing an [[abugida]] such as the system of writing [[Amharic]] (written using the Ge'ez alphabet, which was formerly an abjad before a vocalization occurred sometime after the 5th century BCE but before the 4th century CE).

==Related concepts==
Surprisingly, many non-Semitic languages such as English can be written without vowels and read with little difficulty. For example, the previous sentence could be written ''Srprsngly, mny nn-Smtc lnggs sch `s `nglsh cn b wrttn wtht vwls `nd rd wth lttl dffclty.'' This fact can be used to semi-bowdlerise offensive language, a practice known as [[disemvoweling]].

Some usages of [[1337speak]] drop vowels, especially for small words.

An '''abugida''', '''alphasyllabary''', or '''syllabics''' is a [[writing system]] composed of signs ([[grapheme]]s) denoting [[consonant]]s with an inherent following [[vowel]], which are consistently modified to indicate other vowels, or, in some cases, the lack of a vowel.  Examples include the various scripts of the [[Brahmic family]], Ethiopic [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]], and [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]. 
 
A typical abugida is [[Devanagari]]. There is no basic sign representing the consonant ''k;'' rather the unmodified letter क represents the syllable ''ka;'' the ''a'' is the so-called &quot;inherent&quot; vowel. The vowel may be changed by adding vowel marks to the basic character, producing other syllables beginning with ''k-,'' such as कि ''ki'', कु ''ku'', के ''ke'',  को ''ko''.  These [[diacritic]]s are applied systematically to other consonantal characters. For example, from ल ''la'' is formed लि ''li'', लु ''lu'', ले ''le'', लो ''lo''. Such a consonant with either an inherent or marked vowel is called an [[akshara]]. 

In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In Devanagari, क् is ''k,'' and ल् is ''l''.  This is called the ''[[virama]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], or ''halant'' in [[Hindi]]. It may be used to form [[consonant cluster]]s, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word.  Other means of expressing these functions include special [[conjunct]] forms in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: क्ल ''kla.'' (Note that on some fonts display this as क् followed by ल, rather than forming a conjunct.)   
 
The diacritics may appear above (के), below (कु), to the left (कि), or to the right (को) of the consonantal character, or may surround it as in [[Tamil script|Tamil]] கௌ = ''kau,'' from க ''ka''.  In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like ि ''-i,'' falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game [[cricket]] in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] is क्रिकेट ''krikeţ;'' the diacritic for /i/ appears before the [[consonant cluster]] /kr/, not before the /r/. A more unusual example is seen in the [[Batak alphabet]]: Here the syllable ''bim'' is written ''ba-ma-i-(virama)''. That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable. 

In Ge’ez, the prototype abugida, the form of the letter itself may be altered. For example, ሀ ''hä'' (basic form), ሁ ''hu'' (with a right-side diacritic that does not alter the letter), ሂ ''hi'' (with a subdiacritic compresses the letter, so that the whole fidel (akshara) occupies the same amount of space), ህ ''he'' (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm). 

In the family of abugidas known as [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]], vowels are indicated by modification (rotation and reflection) of the akshara. For example, Inuktitut ᐱ ''pi,'' ᐳ ''pu,'' ᐸ ''pa;'' ᑎ ''ti,'' ᑐ ''tu,'' ᑕ ''ta''.

The [[Róng]] script used for the [[Lepcha language]] goes further than other abugidas in that each akshara is a full syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would written as something like {{IPA|s̥̽}}, here with an underring representing /o/ and an overcross representing the diacritic for final /k/. There are several abugidas of Indonesia which also indicate final consonants with diacritics, but usually these are restricted to one or two [[nasal consonant|nasals]] such as /ŋ/. 

The [[Pahawh Hmong]] script represents both consonants and vowels with full letters. However, the graphic order is vowel-consonant even though they are pronounced as consonant-vowel. This is rather like the /o/ vowel in the Indic abugidas. Pahawh Hmong is unusual in that, while the inherent vowel /au/ is unwritten, so is the inherent consonant /k/. For the syllable /kau/, which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is /au/ that is written. That is, a Pahawh akshara appears to be a vowel with an inherent consonant rather than the other way around. 

It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] scrips. For example, the [[Meroitic script]] of ancient [[Sudan]] did not indicate an inherent ''a'' (one symbol stood for both ''m'' and ''ma,'' for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel. 

[[Thaana]] is also like an abugida in that vowels are marked with diacritics. However, all vowels are marked, as is the absence of a vowel; there is no inherent vowel. Normally no letter may occur without a diacritic. That is, it is equivalent to an [[abjad]] with obligatory vowel marking, like the [[Arabic alphabet]] as used for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in Iraq, as is thus essentially alphabetic. Note that it developed among a population that was already literate with an abugida for their language. 

Several systems of [[shorthand]] use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to Thaana and Kurdish than to the Brahmic scripts. The [[Sam Pollard|Pollard]] script, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. 

As the term ''alphasyllabary'' suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from [[abjad|abjads]] (vowelless alphabets).  They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary: か ''ka'', き ''ki'', く ''ku'', け ''ke'', こ ''ko'' have nothing in common to indicate ''k;'' while ら ''ra'', り ''ri'', る ''ru'', れ ''re'', ろ ''ro'' have neither anything in common for ''r'', nor anything do indicate that they have the same vowels as the ''k'' set. 

The term ''abugida'' is taken from a conventional name for the Ge'ez script, derived from its first four letters (አቡጊዳ) as ordered 
in some religious contexts.  This order corresponds to the ancestral [[Semitic]] character order, ''aleph, beth, gimel, daleth,'' or A B C D.

Historically, abugidas appear to have first evolved from abjads (perhaps [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]) with the [[Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brāhmī]] scripts. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendents include most of the modern scripts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Canadian Syllabics was derived from Devanagari, and is thus in the Brahmic family, or was at least influenced by Devanagari in its creation. Although Ge’ez derived from a different abjad, its evolution into an abugida may have been due to the influence of Christian missionaries from India.

AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a [[retrovirus]] that primarily infects vital components of the human [[immune system]] such as CD4+ [[T cell]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. It also directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough CD4+ cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system barely works, leading to AIDS. Acute HIV infection progresses over time to clinical latent HIV infection and then to early symptomatic HIV infection and later, to AIDS, which is identified on the basis of the amount of [[CD4]] positive cells in the blood and the presence of certain infections.

Since June 18, 1981, many different definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the [[Bangui definition]] and the [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]]. However, these were never intended to be used for clinical staging of patients, for which they are neither sensitive nor specific. The [[World Health Organization]]s (WHO) staging system for HIV infection and disease, using clinical and laboratory data, can be used in developing countries and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) Classification System can be used in developed nations. 

====WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease====
{{main|WHO Disease Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease}}
In 1990, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) grouped these infections and conditions together by introducing a staging system for patients infected with HIV-1 &lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID |1974812}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was updated in September 2005. Most of these conditions are [[opportunistic infections]] that can be easily treated in healthy people.

: ''Stage I:'' HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as AIDS
: ''Stage II:'' include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections
: ''Stage III:'' includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis or
: ''Stage IV'' includes [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]; these diseases are used as indicators of AIDS.

====CDC Classification System for HIV Infection====
{{main|CDC Classification System for HIV Infection}}
In the [[USA]], the definition of AIDS is governed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). In 1993, the CDC expanded their definition of AIDS to include healthy HIV positive people with a CD4 positive T cell count of less than 200 per µl of blood. The majority of new AIDS cases in the United States are reported on the basis of a low [[T cell]] count in the presence of HIV infection &lt;ref name=MMWR&gt;{{

===HIV test===
{{main|HIV test}}
Approximately half of those infected with HIV don't know that they are infected until they are diagnosed with AIDS. HIV test kits are used to screen donor blood and blood products, and to diagnose HIV in individuals. Typical HIV tests, including the HIV enzyme immunoassay and the Western blot assay, detect HIV antibodies in serum, plasma, oral fluid, dried blood spot or urine of patients.  Other tests to look for HIV antigens, HIV-RNA, and HIV-DNA are also commercially available and can be used to detect HIV infection prior to the development of detectable antibodies.  However, these assays are not specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of HIV infection.

==Symptoms and Complications==
[[Image:Hiv-timecourse.png|400px|thumb|right|A generalized graph of the relationship between HIV copies (viral load) and CD4 counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection; any particular individuals' disease course may vary considerably.]]
The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy [[immune system]]s. Most of these conditions are infections caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus|viruses]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages. [[Opportunistic infection]]s are common in people with AIDS &lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nearly every [[organ system]] is affected. People with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as [[Kaposi sarcoma]], [[cervical cancer]] and cancers of the immune system known as [[lymphoma]]s. 

Additionally, people with AIDS often have systemic symptoms of infection like [[fever]]s, [[sweat]]s (particularly at night), swollen glands, chills, weakness, and weight loss &lt;ref name=Guss&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, the specific opportunistic infections that AIDS patients develop depends in part on the prevalence of these infections in the geographic area in which the patient lives.

===The major pulmonary illnesses===
*'''''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia''': [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia]] (originally known as ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia, often abbreviated PCP) is relatively rare in normal, [[immunocompetent]] people but common among HIV-infected individuals. Before the advent of effective treatment and diagnosis in Western countries it was a common immediate cause of death. In developing countries, it is still one of the first indications of AIDS in untested individuals, although it does not generally occur unless the CD4 count is less than 200 per µl &lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15735422}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

*'''Tuberculosis''': Among infections associated with HIV, [[tuberculosis]] (TB) is unique in that it may be transmitted to immunocompetent persons via the respiratory route, is easily treatable once identified, may occur in early-stage HIV disease, and is preventable with drug therapy. However, multi-drug resistance is a potentially serious problem. Even though its incidence has declined because of the use of directly observed therapy and other improved practices in Western countries, this is not the case in developing countries where HIV is most prevalent. In early-stage HIV infection (CD4 count &amp;gt;300 cells per µl), TB typically presents as a pulmonary disease. In advanced HIV infection, TB may present atypically and extrapulmonary TB is common infecting [[bone marrow]], [[bone]], urinary and [[gastrointestinal tract]]s, liver, regional lymph nodes, and the central nervous system &lt;ref name=Decker&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===The major gastro-intestinal illnesses===
* '''Esophagitis''': [[Esophagitis]] is an inflammation of the lining of the lower end of the [[esophagus]] (gullet or swallowing tube leading to the stomach). In HIV infected individuals, this could be due to fungus ([[candidiasis]]), virus ([[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex-1]] or [[cytomegalovirus]]). In rare cases, it could be due to [[mycobacteria]] &lt;ref name=Zaidi&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|12942677}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

* '''Unexplained chronic diarrhea''': In HIV infection, there are many possible causes of [[diarrhea]], including common bacterial (''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', or ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') and parasitic infections, and uncommon opportunistic infections such as [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[microsporidiosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]'' complex (MAC) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. Diarrhea may follow a course of antibiotics (common for ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''). It may also be a side effect of several drugs used to treat HIV, or it may simply accompany HIV infection, particularly during primary HIV infection. In the later stages of HIV infection, diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the intestinal tract absorbs nutrients, and may be an important component of HIV-related wasting &lt;ref name=Guerrant&gt;{{

===The major neurological illnesses===
* '''Toxoplasmosis''': [[Toxoplasmosis]] is a disease caused by the single-celled parasite called ''Toxoplasma gondii''. ''T. gondii'' usually infects the brain causing toxoplasma encephalitis. It can also infect and cause disease in the eyes and lungs &lt;ref name=Luft&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy''': [[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) is a [[demyelinating disease]], in which the [[myelin]] sheath covering the [[axons]] of nerve cells is gradually destroyed, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses. It is caused by a virus called [[JC virus]] which occurs in 70% of the population in [[latent]] form, causing disease only when the immune system has been severly weakened, as is the case for AIDS patients. It progresses rapidly, usually causing death within months of diagnosis &lt;ref name=Sadler&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several of these, [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], high-grade [[lymphoma]], and [[cervical cancer]] confer a diagnosis of AIDS when they occur in an HIV-infected person.
   
* '''Kaposi's sarcoma:''' [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] is the most common tumor in HIV-infected patients.  The appearance of this tumor in young gay men in 1981 was one of the first signals of the AIDS epidemic.  It is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus]] (KSHV).  It often appears as purplish nodules on the skin, but other organs, especially the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs can be affected.

* '''High-grade lymphoma:''' Several high-grade B cell lymphomas have substantially increased incidence in HIV-infected patients and often portend a poor prognosis.  The most common AIDS-defining lymphomas are [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], Burkitt's-like lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including primary central nervous system lymphoma.  [[Primary effusion lymphoma]] is less common.  Many of these lymphomas are caused by either [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) or KSHV.

* '''Cervical cancer:''' [[Cervical cancer]] in HIV-infected women is also considered AIDS-defining.  It is caused by [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).

* '''Other tumors:''' In addition to the AIDS-defining tumors listed above, HIV-infected patients are also at increased risk of certain other tumors, such as [[Hodgkin's disease]] and [[anal carcinoma|anal]] and [[rectal carcinoma|rectal carcinomas]].  However, the incidence of many common tumors, such as [[breast cancer]] or [[colon cancer]], are not increased in HIV-infected patients.  Most AIDS-associated malignancies are caused by co-infection of patients with an oncogenic DNA virus, especially [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV), [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).  In areas where [[HAART]] is extensively used to treat AIDS, the incidence of many AIDS-related malignancies has decreased, but at the same time malignancies overall have become the most common cause of death of HIV-infected patients &lt;ref name=Bonnet&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15241829}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Other opportunistic infections===
Patients with AIDS and severe immunosuppression often develop opportunistic infections that present with non-specific symptoms, especially low grade fevers and weight loss.  These include infection with ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]-intracellulare'' and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV). CMV can also cause colitis, as described above, and CMV retinitis can cause blindness. [[Penicilliosis]] due to ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'' is now the third most common opportunistic infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcosis) in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia &lt;ref name=Skoulidis&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15286196}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Transmission==
Since the beginning of the [[epidemic]], three main transmission routes of HIV have been identified:

* '''Sexual route.''' The majority of HIV infections have been, and still are, acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission occurs when there is contact between sexual secretions of one partner with the rectal, genital or mouth [[Mucous membrane|mucous membranes]] of another.

* '''Blood or blood product route.''' This transmission route is particularly important for intravenous drug users, [[Haemophilia|hemophiliac]]s and recipients of [[blood transfusion]]s and blood products. Health care workers (nurses, laboratory workers, doctors etc) are also concerned, although more rarely. Also concerned by this route are people who give and receive tattoos and piercings.

* '''Mother-to-child route (vertical transmission).''' The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur ''in utero'' during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child was 20%. However, where treatment is available, combined with the availability of [[Cesarian section]], this has been reduced to 1%.

HIV has been found in the [[saliva]], [[tears]] and [[urine]] of infected individuals, but due to the low concentration of virus in these biological liquids, the risk is considered to be negligible.

The diverse transmission routes of HIV are well-known and established. Also well-known is how to prevent transmission of HIV. However, recent epidemiological and behavioral studies in Europe and North America have suggested that a substantial minority of young people continue to engage in high-risk practices and that despite HIV/AIDS knowledge, young people underestimate their own risk of becoming infected with HIV &lt;ref name=Dias&gt;{{

===Prevention of sexual transmission of HIV===
====Underlying science====
Unprotected receptive sexual acts are at more risk than unprotected insertive sexual acts, with the risk for transmitting HIV from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected insertive anal intercourse greater than the risk for transmission through vaginal intercourse or oral sex. Oral sex is not without its risks as it has been established that HIV can be transmitted through both insertive and receptive oral sex &lt;ref name=Rothenberg&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|9833850}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Sexually-transmitted infection]]s (STI) increase the risk of HIV transmission and infection because they cause the disruption of the normal epithelial barrier by genital ulceration and/or microulceration; and by accumulation of pools of HIV-susceptible or HIV-infected cells ([[lymphocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s) in semen and vaginal secretions. Epidemiological studies from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America have suggested that there is approximately a four times greater risk of becoming HIV-infected in the presence of a genital ulcer such as caused by [[syphilis]] and/or [[chancroid]]; and a significant though lesser increased risk in the presence of STIs such as [[gonorrhoea]], [[chlamydia]]l infection and [[trichomoniasis]] which cause local accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages &lt;ref name=Laga&gt;{{

Transmission of HIV depends on the infectiousness of the [[index case]] and the susceptibility of the uninfected partner. Infectivity seems to vary during the course of illness and is not constant between individuals. An undetectable plasma viral load does not mean that you have a low viral load in the seminal liquid or genital secretions. Each 10 fold increment of seminal HIV RNA is associated with an 81% increased rate of HIV transmission &lt;ref name=Laga&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, people who are infected with HIV can still be infected by other, more virulent strains.

====Prevention strategies====
During a sexual act, only [[condom]]s, be they male or female, can reduce the chances of infection with HIV and other STIs and the chances of becoming pregnant. They must be used during all penetrative sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV positive or whose status is unknown &lt;ref name=Cayley&gt;{{

  | id={{PMID|15508535}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The effective use of condoms and screening of blood transfusion in North America, Western and Central Europe is credited with the low rates of AIDS in these regions. 

Promoting condom use, however, has often proved controversial and difficult. Many religious groups, most visibly the [[Roman Catholic Church]], have opposed the use of condoms on religious grounds, and have sometimes seen condom promotion as an affront to the promotion of marriage, monogamy and sexual morality. Other religious groups have argued that preventing HIV infection is a moral task in itself and that condoms are therefore acceptable or even praiseworthy from a religious point of view. 

[[Image:ThreeColoredRolledUpCondoms.jpg|thumb|right|Condoms in many colors]]
''The male latex condom'' is the single most efficient available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. In order to be effective, they must be used correctly during each sexual act. Lubricants containing oil, such as petroleum jelly, or butter, must not be used as they weaken [[latex]] condoms and make them porous. If necessary, lubricants made from water are recommended. However, it is not recommended to use a lubricant for fellatio. Also, condoms have standards and expiration dates. It is essential to check the expiration date and if it conforms to European (EC 600) or American (D3492) standards before use. 

''[[Condom#Female condoms|The female condom]]'' is an alternative to the male condom and is made from [[polyurethane]], which allows it to be used in the presence of oil-based lubricants. They are larger than male condoms and have a stiffened ring-shaped opening, and are designed to be inserted into the vagina. The female condom also contains an inner ring which keeps the condom in place inside the vagina - inserting the female condom requires squeezing this ring.  
With consistent and correct use of condoms, there is a very low risk of HIV infection. Studies on couples where one partner is infected show that with consistent condom use, HIV infection rates for the uninfected partner are below 1% per year &lt;ref name=WHOCondoms&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Governmental programs====
The U.S. government and U.S. health organizations both endorse the '''''ABC Approach''''' to lower the risk of acquiring AIDS during sex:

: '''A'''bstinence or delay of sexual activity, especially for youth,
: '''B'''eing faithful, especially for those in committed relationships,
: '''C'''ondom use, for those who engage in risky behavior.

This approach has been very successful in [[Uganda]], where HIV prevalence has decreased from 15% to 5%. However, the ABC approach is far from all that Uganda has done, as &quot;''Uganda has pioneered approaches towards reducing stigma, bringing discussion of sexual behavior out into the open, involving HIV-infected people in public education, persuading individuals and couples to be tested and counseled, improving the status of women, involving religious organizations, enlisting traditional healers, and much more.''&quot; (Edward Green, [[Harvard]] medical anthropologist). Also, it must be noted that there is no conclusive proof that abstinence-only programs have been successful in any country in the world in reducing HIV transmission. This is why condom use is heavily co-promoted. There is also considerable overlap with the '''''CNN Approach'''''. This is:

: '''C'''ondom use, for those who engage in risky behavior.
: '''N'''eedles, use clean ones
: '''N'''egotiating skills; negotiating safer sex with a partner and empowering women to make smart choices

The '''ABC approach''' has been criticized, because a faithful partner of an unfaithful partner is at risk of AIDS &lt;ref name=EconomistABC&gt;{{

===Prevention of blood or blood product route of HIV transmission===
====Underlying science====
Sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood represents a major risk for infection with not only HIV but also [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]]. In the United States a third of all new HIV infections can be traced to needle sharing and almost 50% of long-term addicts have hepatitis C. The risk of being infected with HIV from a single prick with a needle that has been used on an HIV infected person though is thought to be about 1 in 150 ([[AIDS#Prevention|see table above]]). [[Post-exposure prophylaxis]] with anti-HIV drugs can further reduce that small risk &lt;ref name=Fan&gt;{{

In countries where improved donor selection and antibody tests have been introduced, the risk of transmitting [[HIV]] infection to [[blood transfusion]] recipients is extremely low. But according to the [[WHO]], the overwhelming majority of the world's population does not have access to safe blood and &quot;between 5% and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products&quot; &lt;ref name=WHO070401&gt;{{

Medical workers who follow [[universal precautions]] or body substance isolation such as wearing latex gloves when giving injections and washing the hands frequently can help prevent infection of HIV. 

All AIDS-prevention organizations advise drug-users not to share needles and other material required to prepare and take drugs (including syringes, cotton balls, the spoons, water for diluting the drug, straws, crack pipes etc). It is important that people use new or properly sterilized needles for each injection. Information on cleaning needles using bleach is available from health care and addiction professionals and from [[needle exchange]]s. In the United States and some other countries, clean needles are available free in some cities, at needle exchanges or [[safe injection site]]s. Additionally, many states within the United States and some other nations have decriminalized needle possession and made it possible to buy injection equipment from pharmacists without a prescription.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In developed countries the risk can of transmission of HIV from mother to child can be as low as 0-5%.  A number of factors influence the risk of infection, particularly the viral load of the mother at birth (the higher the load, the higher the risk). Breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission by 10–15%. This risk depends on clinical factors and may vary according to the pattern and duration of breastfeeding.

Current optimal HAART options consist of combinations (or &quot;cocktails&quot;) consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or &quot;classes,&quot; of [[anti-retroviral]] agents.  Typical regimens consist of two [[nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs) plus either a [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, anti-retroviral drugs are costly, and the majority of the world's infected individuals do not have access to medications and treatments for HIV and AIDS.

Research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs, further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence, and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance.

A number of studies have shown that measures to prevent opportunistic infections can be beneficial when treating patients with HIV infection or AIDS.  Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for patients who are not infected with these viruses and are at risk of getting infected.  In addition, AIDS patients should receive vaccination against [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] and should receive yearly vaccination against [[influenza virus]].  Patients with substantial immunosuppression are generally advised to receive prophylactic therapy for [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia]] (PCP), and many patients may benefit from prophylactic therapy for [[toxoplasmosis]] and [[Cryptococcus]] meningitis.  

===Alternative medicine===
Ever since AIDS entered the public consciousness, various forms of [[alternative medicine]] have been used to try to treat symptoms or to try to affect the course of the disease itself. In the first decade of the epidemic when no useful conventional treatment was available, a large number of people with AIDS experimented with [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]]. The definition of &quot;alternative therapies&quot; in AIDS has changed since that time. During that time, the phrase often referred to community-driven treatments, not being tested by government or pharmaceutical company research, that some hoped would directly suppress the virus or stimulate immunity against it. These kinds of approaches have become less common over time as AIDS drugs have become more effective. 

The phrase then and now also refers to other approaches that people hoped would improve their symptoms or their quality of life--for instance, massage, herbal and flower remedies and [[acupuncture]]; when used with conventional treatment, many now refer to these as &quot;complementary&quot; approaches. None of these treatments have been proven in controlled trials to have any effect in treating HIV or AIDS directly. However, some may improve feelings of well-being in people who believe in their value. Additionally, people with AIDS, like people with other illnesses such as [[cancer]], also sometimes use [[marijuana]] to treat pain, combat nausea and stimulate appetite.

[[UNAIDS]] and the WHO estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million (between 2.8 and 3.6 million) lives in 2005 of which more than half a million (570,000) were children &lt;ref name=UNAIDS&gt;{{

The development of [[HAART]] as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS has substantially reduced the death rate from this disease in those areas where it is widely available. This has created the misperception that the disease has gone away. In fact, as the life expectancy of persons with AIDS has increased in countries where HAART is widely used, the number of persons living with AIDS has increased substantially.  In the United States, for example, the number of persons with AIDS increased from about 35,000 in 1988 to over 220,000 in 1996 &lt;ref name=CDC1996&gt;{{

==Origin of HIV/AIDS==
{{main|AIDS origin}}
The official date for the beginning of the AIDS epidemic is marked as [[June 18]], [[1981]], when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] and Prevention reported a cluster of [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia]] (now classified as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in five gay men in [[Los Angeles]] &lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{

  | accessdate=2006-01-17

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally dubbed GRID, or Gay-Related [[Immunodeficiency|Immune Deficiency]], health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not gay. In 1982, the CDC introduced the term AIDS to describe the newly recognized syndrome.

Three of the earliest known instances of HIV infection are as follows:

Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to [[West Africa]] &lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are of primate origin.  The origin of HIV-1 is the [[Common Chimpanzee|Central Common Chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes''). The origin of HIV-2 has been established to be the [[Sooty Mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys''), an Old World monkey of Guinea Bissau, Gabon, and Cameroon.

One currently controversial possibility for the origin of HIV/AIDS was discussed in a [[1992]] Rolling Stone magazine article by freelance journalist Tom Curtis.  He put forward the theory that AIDS was inadvertantly caused in the late 1950's in the [[Belgian Congo]] by [[Hilary Koprowski]]'s research into a [[polio]] [[vaccine]] &lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although subsequently retracted due to [[libel]] issues surrounding its claims, the Rolling Stone article motivated another freelance journalist, [[Edward Hooper]], to probe more deeply into this subject.   Hooper's research resulted in his publishing a 1999 book, [[The River]], in which he alleged that an experimental oral [[polio]] [[vaccine]] prepared using  [[chimpanzee]] kidney tissue was the route through which [[SIV]] crossed into humans to become HIV, thus starting the

'''ABBA''' ([[1972]]–[[1983]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pop music]] group. They remain the most successful Swedish music act and were one of the most popular groups in the world. The group dominated charts worldwide during the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, selling many [[ABBA discography|hit singles and albums]]. Estimates of ABBA's total worldwide sales vary from 300 to 400 million (there seems to be no reliable source for this information) which could make them the second most successful band of all time after [[The Beatles]]. They were the first act from the European mainland to become a regular fixture in [[UK Singles Chart|British]], [[Hot 100 Singles Sales|American]] and [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] charts, and their success subsequently opened the doors for many other European acts. Their lasting legacy is the legitimising of the Swedish music industry as a mainstream player.

ABBA was formed around [[1972]] with [[Björn Ulvaeus]], [[Benny Andersson]], [[Agnetha Fältskog]], and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] (nicknamed &quot;Frida&quot;). They became widely known after winning the [[1974]] [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with &quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot;. The group consisted of two couples, Björn and Agnetha along with Benny and Frida. ABBA collectively decided to take a break at the beginning of [[1983]]. They have yet to record together again in the studio.
 
''ABBA'' is an [[acronym]] formed from the first letters of each group member's name. It is usually written '''ABBA''' but is sometimes written as a word, '''Abba'''. The first ''B'' in the [[logo]] version of the name was reversed on the band's promotional material from [[1976]] onwards.

==History==
===Before ABBA===
Benny Andersson was a member of the Swedish rock / pop band [[Hep Stars]] who were very popular in Sweden during the 1960s. The band was modeled after various US and UK groups such as [[Herman's Hermits]], [[The Who]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The Hep Stars had a huge following, especially among teenage girls. Meanwhile Björn Ulvaeus was fronting a [[skiffle]] group called the [[Hootenanny Singers]] whose sound was softer and more easy-listening than the Hep Stars. The singers crossed paths sometimes and they decided to write songs together. One of these, &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say,&quot; became a hit for the Hep Stars and Björn sometimes guested with the band on tour. It was even suggested that the two bands merge but this never happened. [[Stikkan Anderson|Stig Anderson]], manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of [[Polar Music]], saw more potential in Benny and Björn working together and encouraged them to write more songs and create an album which was eventually called ''Lycka'' (&quot;Happiness&quot;) when released on the Polar label.

Agnetha Fältskog was ABBA's youngest member and a pop phenomenon in her own right who wrote and performed Swedish hits while in her teens and had also played [[Mary Magdalene]] in the Swedish production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. Agnetha was noted by critics and songwriters as an accomplished composer but she considered it hard work, writing and performing light pop songs in the [[Schlager]] style, recording [[cover version|covers]] of hit songs and touring Swedish [[folkpark]]s, the main &quot;live circuit&quot; at that time. Inevitably she bumped into the Hootenanny Singers on their folkpark tours, meeting and eventually falling in love with Björn. Their marriage in [[1971]] was the Swedish celebrity wedding of the year and drew much publicity.

Housewife Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad was a part-time cabaret singer who decided to enter a talent competition and won. Sweden was [[Dagen H|changing over]] from driving on the left side of the road to the right and a series of spectacular shows was being aired to encourage people to stay off the roads on the night of the switchover. Invited to appear on TV that evening with her winning song, Frida's musical career took off. She met Benny Andersson on the wonted folkpark tour. They became lovers and Benny invited Anni-Frid to sing backing vocals with Agnetha on the ''Lycka'' album. The two women were uncredited for this work.

===Early years===
[[Image:People_Need_Love_small.jpg|frame|right|The cover of &quot;People Need Love,&quot; the first single released by the group.]]

By the early 1970s, although Björn and Agnetha were married, they pursued their own separate musical careers. However Stig was ambitious and determined to break into the mainstream international market, not something that Swedish acts were usually known for, though previously achieved by Swedish instrumental guitar group [[The Spotnicks]] (their best known hit was &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;). As a result he encouraged Björn and Benny to write a song for the [[1972]] [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and it was performed by Lena Anderson. &quot;Say It With a Song&quot; won third in the contest selection rounds but was a huge hit in several countries, convincing Stig he was on the right track.

Björn and Benny persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements which brought some success in [[Japan]]. One of the songs they came up with was &quot;[[People Need Love]],&quot; featuring guest vocals by the girls who were now given much greater prominence than previously. Everyone involved felt enthusiastic about the new sound and Stig released it as a single, credited to ''Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid''. The record reached number 17 in the Swedish charts, enough to convince them they were on to something.


[[Image:Ringring1973sleeve.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The cover of the [[1973]] version of the album ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]''.]]

The following year they decided to have another crack at Eurovision, this time with the song &quot;[[Ring Ring (English version)|Ring Ring]].&quot; The studio work was handled by [[Michael B. Tretow]] who experimented with a [[Phil Spector]]-like &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; production technique that became the wholly new ABBA sound. Stig arranged an English translation of the lyrics by [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Phil Cody]] and they thought this would be a sure-fire winner. Yet again, it came in third. Nevertheless the proto-group put out an album called ''[[Ring Ring (album)|Ring Ring]]'', still carrying the awkward naming of ''Björn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida''. The album did well and the &quot;Ring Ring&quot; single was a hit in many parts of Europe but Stig felt the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.

Around this time Stig, having tired of the unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ''ABBA''. This was done as a joke at first, since Abba was also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden. However, since the fish canners were more or less unknown outside Sweden, Stig came to believe the name would work in international markets and so it stuck. Later the group negotiated with the canners for the right to use the name.

===Eurovision and after===
[[Image:Waterloo Watch Out.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot; ([[1974]])]]
[[Image:Mammamiasingle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Mamma Mia]]&quot; ([[1975]])]]
They tried [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]] again in [[1974]], now inspired by the growing [[glam rock]] scene in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and tracks like [[Wizzard]]'s &quot;See My Baby Jive&quot;. &quot;Waterloo&quot; was an unashamedly glam-style pop track produced with Michael B. Tretow's wall of sound approach. Now far more experienced, they were better prepared for the contest and had an album's worth of material released when the show was held in [[Brighton, England]]. The song won hands down and catapulted them into British consciousness for the first time. Now they had a catchy name, ABBA, and people could buy the whole album (''Waterloo'') straightaway.

&quot;[[Waterloo (English version)|Waterloo]]&quot;  was ABBA's first UK No. 1. It was also released in the [[United States|US]], reaching No. 6. But momentum proved hard to maintain, and their follow-up singles &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Honey Honey&quot; did not do nearly as well. The group was overstretched and unable to promote the songs convincingly in any one country. Moreover, much of their material was still heavily derivative. It wasn't until the release of their second proper album ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' and their single &quot;[[SOS (song)|SOS]]&quot; that ABBA began to show the first signs they were destined for bigger things. &quot;SOS&quot; consolidated ABBA's presence in the UK where it was a Top 10 hit and they were no longer regarded as a [[one-hit wonder]].

Much wider success came in [[1975]] with every release charting solidly and &quot;[[Mamma Mia (song)|Mamma Mia]]&quot; reaching the UK No. 1 spot in January [[1976]]. 

At this time the band released the somewhat hubristically titled ''[[Greatest Hits (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album despite having had only five Top 40 hits in the UK and the US. This album included &quot;[[Fernando (single)|Fernando]]&quot;  (an earlier version had been a Swedish-language hit single for Anni-Frid and included on her 1975 Benny-produced solo LP ''[[Frida Ensam]]''). Becoming one of ABBA's best-known tracks, &quot;Fernando&quot; did not appear on the Swedish or Australian releases of ''Greatest Hits''. In Sweden the song would wait until 1982's ''The Singles-The First Ten Years'' to appear in an English-language version credited to ABBA; the track was later included in the Australian release of their [[1976]] album, ''[[Arrival (ABBA_album)|Arrival]]''.

The next album, ''Arrival'', represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work for ABBA. Hit after hit flowed from it: &quot;[[Money, Money, Money]]&quot;, &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You (single)|Knowing Me, Knowing You]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dancing Queen (single)|Dancing Queen]]&quot;, their most enduring and definitive hit. By this time ABBA were widely popular in the UK, most of Western Europe and [[Australia]] (who in a way almost &quot;adopted&quot; ABBA as their own) but still had only moderate recognition and airplay in the US, and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; remains the only No. 1 ABBA ever achieved there.

[[Image:abbamovieposter.jpg|thumb|right|Movie poster for ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'' and ''[[The Album]]'' carried the same artwork.]]
By this time the ABBA sound was synonymous with European pop and was widely copied by groups like [[Brotherhood of Man]] and later, [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]]. Some felt it was necessary to copy ABBA's sound and two girl/two boy approach to win Eurovision, and the notion seemed validated when Brotherhood of Man won in 1976 and Bucks Fizz took the prize in [[1981]]. 

Meanwhile in [[1977]] ABBA followed up ''Arrival'' with the more complex ''[[The Album]]'' which was released to coincide with ''[[ABBA: The Movie]]'', a feature film of their Australian tour. This album was less well-received by the critics but spawned several hits, &quot;[[The Name of the Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[Take A Chance On Me|Take a Chance on Me]]&quot;, both of which topped the UK charts. This album also carried the well-known &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; that later was released in the UK as a single ([[1983]]) and had been a B-side of &quot;Eagle&quot; in territories where that song was released as a single.

===Later years===
By [[1978]] ABBA was a megagroup. They converted a disused cinema into the Polar Music Studio, a new state-of-the-art studio in [[Stockholm]] which was used by several other successful bands ([[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' was recorded there, for example). 

Their standalone single &quot;[[Summer Night City]]&quot;, their last Swedish number one, stopped just short of topping the UK charts but set the stage for ABBA's foray into [[disco]] with the album ''[[Voulez-Vous]]'', which was released in Spring [[1979]]. This release marked a slight decline in ABBA's popularity in the UK and Europe but gained them more attention in the US. The hits still came: &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;, &quot;[[Does Your Mother Know]]&quot;, &quot;[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Have A Dream (ABBA song)|I Have A Dream]]&quot; all charted. In January 1979, the group performed at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]], performing &quot;[[Chiquitita]]&quot;; the [[royalties]] from the song were donated to [[UNICEF]].

Later that year, the group released their second greatest hits album, Greatest Hits Vol 2, which featured a brand new track &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot;, their best known [[disco]] hit.

In [[1979]] ABBA toured the US and Canada, playing to huge audiences, but the breakthrough there was perhaps too little, too late. 

[[1980]]'s ''[[Super Trouper]]'' reflected a change in ABBA's style with more prominent [[synthesiser]]s and more personal lyrics. It set a record for the most preorders ever received for a UK album after 1 million copies were ordered before release. Anticipation for the release had been built up by &quot;[[The Winner Takes It All]]&quot;, the group's eighth UK chart topper (their first since [[1978]]). This song was allegedly written about Bjorn and Agnetha's marriage, which was breaking down at the time. The next single from the album, &quot;[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]&quot; also hit number 1. &quot;[[Lay All Your Love On Me]]&quot; was an album track that was released in 1981 as a 12-inch single only in limited territories, and, along with Super Trouper, managed to top the American club and dance chart. A Spanish language compilation album was also recorded at this time - 'Gracias Por La Musica', which was released in Latin America and sold very well.

''[[The Visitors]]'' ([[1981]]), their final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placed the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies.  ''The Visitors''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; title track refers to secret meetings held against the approval of Communist governments in Soviet satellite states and other tracks address topics like aging, loss of innocence, a parent watching her child grow up and so on. Their melodies were still catchy but their change of style was reflected by the start of a commercial decline after their final great pop single &quot;[[One Of Us (ABBA song)|One Of Us]]&quot; which was a worldwide hit in December 1981.

Although by this time regarded as a group in decline, ABBA still drew huge audiences, particularly in continental Europe and might have gone on indefinitely if it were not for the band's personal turmoils: the two married couples were both divorced by this point. Songs like &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; and &quot;One Of Us&quot; gave glimpses of personal issues ABBA's members were facing. 

In summer 1982, the group gathered to record a new album. In the end they settled for a double album compilation of all their past successes with two new songs. The double album ''[[The Singles: The First Ten Years]]'' topped the UK album chart and was a worldwide bestseller. The new tracks were &quot;[[Under Attack]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Day Before You Came]]&quot;, which was the last song ABBA ever recorded together. Two other songs were recorded during 1982, &quot;I Am The City&quot; and &quot;Just Like That&quot;. While both were completed, only &quot;I Am The City&quot; was released on the compilation album ''More ABBA Gold'' in 1993. Despite numerous efforts from fans, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson are still refusing to release &quot;[[Just Like That (ABBA song)|Just Like That]]&quot; in its entirety.

The group gradually drifted apart as they began pursuing different projects. Benny and Björn collaborated with [[Tim Rice]] to write the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', while Agnetha and Frida worked on solo albums.

==After ABBA==
Björn and Benny wrote the music for the [[West End]] show ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' ([[1984]]) with lyricist [[Tim Rice]]. ''Chess'' ran for three years in London. The show also opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the US ([[1988]]) but the song order, lyrics and storyline had been altered compared with the London version, and was less successful; the show closed within weeks. &quot;Chess&quot; is best known today for producing the international hit &quot;[[One Night in Bangkok]]&quot;, sung by [[Murray Head]].

Björn and Benny, inspired by the successes of Rice and his former collaborator [[Andrew Lloyd-Webber]], had long expressed their desire to write a musical. Their first attempt had been a &quot;mini-musical&quot;, ''The Girl with The Golden Hair'', performed by the group during their 1977 tour of Europe and Australia. Excerpts were included in ''ABBA - The Movie'' and ''ABBA - The Album''. Björn and Benny followed ''Chess'' with ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' ([[1995]]), directed for the stage by [[Lars Rudolfsson]] and based on the ''Emigrants'' [[tetralogy]] by Swedish novelist [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around ABBA's songs, had its London premiere in [[1999]]. In 2003, their first musical was given new life in a Swedish-language version, ''Chess På Svenska''.

After being largely forgotten throughout most of the 1980s, ABBA experienced a resurgence. The attention was often ironic, along the lines of &quot;they were so [[wikt:naff|naff]] they were good,&quot; yet others recognised that while ABBA was often panned by critics and sneered at by [[punk rock|punk]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] musicians they were masters of their art, the three minute pop song. [[1992]] saw a huge revival of interest in ABBA, with the release of their [[ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]] compilation album selling massively worldwide and setting chart longevity records. The revival was further validated by the [[1994]] film &quot;[[Muriel's Wedding]]&quot;, a popular Australian film starring an ABBA-loving protaganist.  Björn and Benny were finally recognised in [[2001]] with an [[Ivor Novello|Ivor Novello Award]] for their songwriting. Many former punk and New Wave artistes later admitted to levels of fondness and respect for ABBA they were unwilling to own up to in their early years.

During the 1990s many ABBA tracks were rediscovered and covered by other artists, such as [[Erasure]], [[Ash (band)|Ash]] and the [[A*Teens]], among others. The avant-garde band [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] had also covered ''The Day Before You Came'' in the mid-1980s, one of the first bands to cover an ABBA track.

On [[April 6]]th 2004 three former ABBA members (Björn, Benny and Frida) showed up together in London for the 30th anniversary of their Eurovision Song Contest win in 1974, appearing on stage after the fifth anniversary performance of ''Mamma Mia!''. In a November 2004 interview with the German magazine ''[[Bunte]]'' Björn said a reunion would not satisfy ABBA's many fans, even though there are legions of them around the world often clamouring for one. In February 2005 all four members of ABBA appeared together in public for the first time since 1986 at the gala opening of ''Mamma Mia!'' in Stockholm.

On [[October 22]] 2005, during the celebration show for the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], ''Waterloo'' was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4366574.stm voted the best] Eurovision song in the history of the contest.

===Post-ABBA solo careers===

Both female members of ABBA have had some success with solo careers following the break-up of the band.

In [[1982]], Frida released her [[Phil Collins]]-produced album ''[[Something's Going On]]'' This album included the hit single &quot;I Know There's Something Going On&quot;. Agnetha followed in [[1983]] with the album ''Wrap Your Arms Around Me''. This album included the hit single ''The Heat Is On'' (a cover of the [[Noosha Fox]] recording) which was a big hit all over Europe and Scandinavia that year. In the US Agnetha scored a Billboard top 30 hit with ''Can't Shake Loose''. Her album sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide. Frida retired after her second solo album ''Shine'' flopped. Agnetha fared better with her second post-ABBA solo album ''Eyes of a Woman''. The album was number two in the Swedish charts and did reasonably well in Europe. 

After ''I Stand Alone'' in [[1987]] Agnetha withdrew from public life and refused to give interviews. In [[1996]] she released her [[autobiography]] called ''As I Am'' and also released a compilation that featured her solo hits. In [[2004]] she released a disc of cover songs called &quot;My Colouring Book&quot; which debuted at number one in Sweden and number six in Germany. The album peaked just outside of the British top ten (number 11) and the single ''If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind'' reached number 9 in the UK singles chart. The album went triple-platinum in Sweden (300,000 copies), gold in Finland and silver in Great Britain.

Frida released ''Shine'' (produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]) in [[1984 in music|1984]] but it was not until 1996 that she released her last album to date, the Swedish-language ''Djupa Andetag'' which was a number one album in Sweden (selling 90,000 copies) but unknown internationally. In September 2004 Frida recorded a song called &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot; with former [[Deep Purple]] member [[Jon Lord]] for his latest album, making some rare appearances on German television.

==Fashion and videos==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:abba2.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Members of ABBA embodied the height of disco glamour in the 70s.]] --&gt;
ABBA was widely noted as an epitome of 1970s fashion for the colourful costumes its members wore. The videos which accompanied some of their biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Though The Beatles and the Rolling Stones had shot the occasional video clip, making promotional videos still hadn't become the industry standard by the early-to-mid 1970s. Most of ABBA's videos (and ''ABBA - The Movie'') were directed by [[Lasse Hallström]] who would later direct the films ''[[My Life as a Dog]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Chocolat (movie)|Chocolat]]''. 

ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in so many different countries and personal appearances weren't always possible. This was also an effort to minimise travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Agnetha and Björn had two young children, and Agnetha, who was also [[Fear of flying|afraid of flying]], was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager Stig Anderson realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one girl's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.
Nowadays, most of their videos can be seen on the DVDs ''ABBA Gold'' and ''The Definitive Collection''.

[[Image:Ringringstill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A still from ABBA's music video, or promo clip, &quot;Ring Ring.&quot;]]
Several ABBA videos were spoofed by others: The video &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; was satirised on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[comedy]] show ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' as &quot;Super Dooper.&quot;  The title ''[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]'' was also borrowed for a spoof chat show on BBC starring [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Alan Partridge]] who always entered the studio shouting &quot;Aha!&quot; (an exclamation in the lyrics). UK comedy duo [[French and Saunders]] parodied ABBA with their song &quot;C'est La Vie&quot;, an homage to &quot;The Winner Takes it All.&quot;  [[Erasure]] paid homage to the ABBA video style with their video for &quot;[[Take a Chance on Me]].&quot;

==Trivia==
*Songwriters Benny and Bj&amp;ouml;rn were unable to [[Musical_notation|notate music]] on paper. Only Agnetha could (as revealed in a [[Dick Cavett]] interview with the group).

*Abba have been spoofed by many TV shows, including ''[[French &amp; Saunders]]'', ''[[Not The Nine O'Clock News]]'' and ''[[Fast Forward]]''. In addition, the character of &quot;[[Alan Partridge]]&quot; is noted as being a huge ABBA fan, especially on his television show &quot;[[Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]&quot; where all the hosts and all guests were introduced with different ABBA songs.

*At the height of their success ABBA was Sweden's biggest export, exceeding even [[Volvo]] cars.

*While selling their music into Russia during the late 1970s ABBA were paid in oil commodities because of an [[embargo]] on the [[rouble]].

*The song ''Chiquitita'' was first performed at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] in [[1979]]. ABBA's performance at the concert was, however, [[lip-synching|lip-synched]]. All royalties from the song were donated to the children's charity [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] in perpetuity.

*In [[1981]], ABBA sponsored the [[ATS]] [[Formula One]] racing team, for whom [[Slim Borgudd]], a former drummer who appeared on some ABBA recordings, was a driver.

*The hit song &quot;Bring Me Edelweiss&quot; ([[1989]]) by [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] features the tune and some lyrics from &quot;S.O.S&quot;. This caused some controversy between Bjorn &amp; Benny, and manager Stig - Stig had granted approval to use the song without consulting the others.

*The sound track of the successful Australian film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' ([[1994]]) prominently featured ABBA songs: The two female leads [[lip sync]] &quot;Waterloo&quot; and the wedding scene is scored to an orchestral rendition of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. The movie also features &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot;.

*Another 1994 Australian fillm ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' features a performance of ''Mamma Mia!'' by two [[drag queen|drag queens]], furthering ABBA's status as a [[gay icon]].

*The ABBA [[tribute band]] [[Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again]] became so successful that as of 2004 there were five casts of Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again performing in various parts of the world. The original Bj&amp;ouml;rn Again had been touring for 15 years, longer than the original group.

*[[techno music|Techno]] and [[house music|house]] remakes of many original ABBA hits were released under the name [[Abbacadabra]].

*''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' was nominated for a Broadway [[Tony Award]] as Best Musical in [[2002]].

*In [[2000]] ABBA were reported to have turned down an offer of approximately one billion dollars (US) to do a reunion tour.

*In 2005 ABBA's 1976 hit single &quot;Fernando&quot; still held the record for the most weeks spent at number one in Australia (along with The Beatles' &quot;Hey Jude&quot;). [http://www.onmc.iinet.net.au/top/1976.htm]

*In addition to being an [[acronym]], the name &quot;ABBA&quot; is also a [[palindrome]]. In 1975, ABBA's &quot;SOS&quot; became the first song with a palindromic title recorded by a group with a palindromic name to hit the pop charts.

*ABBA was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in [[2002]].

*In the film ''[[Johnny English]]'', the title character ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is discretely characterized as an ABBA fan. He sings &quot;Thank You for The Music&quot;, and lip-syncs to &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; in front of a mirror.

* [[The Fugees]] sampled [[ABBA]] (as well as [[Crystal Gayle]]) for their contribution to the [[1996]] &quot;[[When We Were Kings]]&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;

*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] sampled the group's &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot; in her [[2005]] single &quot;[[Hung Up]]&quot;.

'''Allegiance''' is the duty which a subject or a [[citizen]] owes to the [[state (law)|state]] or to the [[Monarch|sovereign]] of the state to which he belongs.

==Origin of the word==

Mid. English ''ligeaunce''; med. Latin ''ligeantia''; the al- was probably added through confusion with another legal term, ''allegeance'', an ''allegation''; the [[French language|French]] ''allegeance'' comes from the English; the word is formed from &quot;liege,&quot; of which the derivation is given under that heading; the connection with [[Latin]] ''ligare'', to bind, is erroneous.

==Usage==

The term ''allegiance'' is often used by English legal commentators in a larger sense, divided by them into natural and local, the latter applying to the deference which even a foreigner must pay to the institutions of the country in which he happens to live; but it is in its proper sense, in which it indicates national character and the subjection due to that character, that the word is important.

In that sense it represents the [[feudal]] [[liege homage]], which could be due only to one lord, while simple [[homage]] might be due to every lord under whom the person in question held land.

==United Kingdom==

The English doctrine, which was at one time adopted in the [[United States]], asserted that allegiance was indelible: &quot;Nemo potest exuere patriam&quot;. Accordingly, as the law stood before [[1870]], every person who by birth or [[naturalization]] satisfied the conditions set forth, though he should be removed in infancy to another country where his family resided, owed an allegiance to the British crown which he could never resign or lose, except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of British territory in which he resided.

Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject to the [[Sovereign]] in return for that protection which the Sovereign affords the subject. It was the mutual bond and obligation between the King or Queen and his or her subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their [[liege]] lord, because he should maintain and defend them (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525; ''China Navigation Co v Attorney-General'' (1932) 48 TLR 375; ''Attorney-General v Nissan'' [1969] 1 All ER 629; ''Oppenheimer v Cattermole'' [1972] 3 All ER 1106). The duty of the Crown towards its subjects is to govern and protect. The reciprocal duty of the subject towards the Crown is that of allegiance. 

At common law allegiance is a true and faithful obedience of the subject due to his Sovereign. As the subject owes to his king his true and faithful allegiance and obedience, so the Sovereign is to govern and protect his subjects, ''regere et protegere subdititos suos'', so as between the Sovereign and subject there is:

*''duplex et reciprocum ligamen; quia sicut subditus regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita rex subdito tenetur ad protectionem; merito igitur ligeantia dicitur a ligando, quia continet in se duplex ligamen'' (''Calvin's Case'' (1608) 7 Co Rep 1a; Jenk 306; 2 State Tr 559; 77 ER 377). 

Natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as he or she is born they owe, by birthright, allegiance and obedience to their Sovereign (''Ex parte Anderson'' (1861) 3 El &amp; El 487; 121 ER 525). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever he or she may be. Where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Allegiance is owed both to the Sovereign as a natural person  and to the Sovereign in his or her political capacity (''Re Stepney Election Petition, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54 (per Lord Coleridge CJ)). Attachment to the person of the reigning Sovereign is not sufficient. Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty (''R v O'Connell'' (1844) 7 ILR 261). 

There were four kinds of allegiances (''Rittson v Stordy'' (1855) 3 Sm &amp; G 230; ''De Geer v Stone'' (1882) 22 Ch D 243; ''Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 54 LT 684; ''Gibson, Gavin v Gibson'' [1913] 3 KB 379; ''Joyce v DPP'' [1946] AC 347; ''Collingwood v Pace'' (1661) O Bridg 410; ''Lane v Bennett'' (1836) 1 M &amp; W 70; ''Lyons Corp v East India Co'' (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; ''Birtwhistle v Vardill'' (1840) 7 Cl &amp; Fin 895; ''R v Lopez, R v Sattler'' (1858) Dears &amp; B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B &amp; S 280); 

(a) ''Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita'', and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called ''alta ligeantia'', and those that owe this are called ''subditus natus''; 
(b) ''Ligeantia acquisita'', not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because he or she is ''subditus datus''; 

(c) ''Ligeantia localis'', by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as he or she is in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance (''R v Cowle'' (1759) 2 Burr 834; ''Low v Routledge'' (1865) 1 Ch App 42; ''Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General'' [1903] 1 Ch 821; ''Tingley v Muller'' [1917] 2 Ch 144; ''Rodriguez v Speyer'' [1919] AC 59; ''Johnstone v Pedlar'' [1921] 2 AC 262; ''R v Tucker'' (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; ''R v Keyn'' (1876) 2 Ex  D 63; ''Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant'' (1886) 17 QBD 54);

(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.

Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in enemy occupied territory). The natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as he or she is born they owe by birthright allegiance and obedience to the Sovereign (''Ex p. Anderson'' (1861) 3 E &amp; E 487). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever they may be, so that where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country (''R v Vermaak'' (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)). 

Acquired allegiance was acquired by naturalisation or denization. Denization, or ''ligeantia acquisita'', appears to be three-fold (''Thomas v Sorrel'' (1673) 3 Keb 143); 

*(a) absolute, as the common denization, without any limitation or restraint; 
*(b) limited, as when the Sovereign grants letters of denization to an alien, and to the heirs males of his or her body, or to an alien for term of his or her life; 
*(c) It may be granted upon condition, ''cujus est dare, ejus est disponere'', and this denization of an alien may come about three ways: by Parliament; by letters patent, which was the usual manner; and by conquest.

Local allegiance was due by an alien while in the protection of the Crown. All friendly resident aliens incurred all the obligations of subjects (''The Angelique'' (1801) 3 Ch Rob App 7). An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony (''Routledge v Low'' (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; ''Reid v Maxwell'' (1886) 2 TLR 790; ''Falcon v Famous Players Film Co'' [1926] 2 KB 474). 

A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary (''de Jager v Attorney-Geneneral of Natal'' [1907] AC 326). 

Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown. 

By the [[Naturalization Act 1870]], it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. So British subjects voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain British subjects within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. [[Emigration]] to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of [[colonial]] expansion.

==United States==

The doctrine that no man can cast off his native allegiance without the consent of his sovereign was early abandoned in the United States, and on [[July 27]], [[1868]], the day before the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was adopted, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] declared in the preamble of the [[Expatriation Act]] that &quot;the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,&quot; and (Section I) one of &quot;the fundamental principles of this government&quot; ([[United States Revised Statutes]], sec. 1999). Every citizen of a foreign state in America owes a double allegiance, one to it and one to the United States. He may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law.

==Oath of allegiance==
''Main article: [[oath of allegiance]]''

The oath of allegiance is an [[oath]] of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization. By ancient common law it might be required of all persons above the age of twelve, and it was repeatedly used as a test for the disaffected. In [[England]] it was first imposed by statute in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]] ([[1558]]) and its form has more than once been altered since. Up to the time of the revolution the promise was, &quot;to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene [[honour]], and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him
therefrom.&quot; This was thought to favour the doctrine of absolute non-resistance, and accordingly the convention parliament enacted the form that has been in use since that time - &quot;I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty ...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Absolute majority''' is a [[supermajority|supermajoritarian]] [[voting]] requirement which is stricter than a [[simple majority]]. It means that more than half of ''all'' the members of a group, including those absent and those present but not voting, must [[vote]] in favour of a proposition in order for that proposition to be passed.

As an example, let's say that a member of a club of 100 members proposes a new [[bylaw]]. According to the club's practice, for the bylaw to pass, it requires an absolute majority.  The results of the vote are 40 yes votes and 30 no votes.  The rest of the voters either abstained or did not vote.  Even though this arrangement is a [[simple majority]], since an absolute majority for the club is 51 members, the proposed bylaw fails.

Absolute majority voting is most often used to pass changes to constitutions or to [[bylaw]]s in order to ensure that there is affirmative support for a proposal. Most voting decisions require a [[simple majority]] or even just a [[plurality]].

==Examples of absolute majority voting==
From 2005, an absolute majority of the electorate in addition to a three-fourths vote of the [[legislature]] is necessary to pass amendments to the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]] as well as to ratify a [[referendum]]. The requirement of an absolute majority rather than a simple majority effectively gives both major political blocs the power to veto a referendum or constitutional amendment.

In the [[politics of the European Union]], any decision taken using the [[codecision procedure]] requires an absolute majority in [[European Parliament]] in order to amend a text in its second reading. (At first reading, only a [[simple majority]] is required.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adventure International''' was a [[Computer and video games|video game]] publishing company that existed from 1978 until 1985, started by Scott and Alexis Adams. Their games were notable for being the first implementation of the adventure genre to run on a microcomputer system. The adventure game concept originally came from [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] which ran strictly on large mainframe systems at the time.

After the success of their first game &quot;Adventureland&quot;, games followed rapidly, with Adventure International (or &quot;AI&quot;) releasing about two games a year. Initially the games were drawn from the founders imagination, with themes ranging from [[fantasy]] to [[Horror fiction|horror]] and sometimes [[science fiction]]. Some of the later games were written by Scott Adams and other collaborators. Adventure Internationals' games became known for quality, with a reputation only exceeded in the field at the time by [[Infocom]].

Fourteen games later, Adventure International began to release games drawn from film and fiction. The extremely rare Buckaroo Banzai game, developed with Phillip Case, was based on the film [[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension]] ([[1984]]). Other games came from a more well known source: [[Marvel Comics]]. Adventure International released three games based on the Marvel characters: &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Torch and the Thing&quot;. 

By the end of [[1982]], game tastes were changing. The traditional text-based [[adventure game]] market had moved to graphical based adventures.  Games like [[The Hobbit (video game)|The Hobbit]] had increased expectations of such games, and although Adventure International games included graphics of a sort, they were significantly inferior to contemporary offerings at the time and the company was rapidly losing [[market share]].

Adventure International went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in [[1985]]. The [[copyright]]s for its games reverted to the bank and eventually back to Scott Adams who released them as [[shareware]].  At its peak in late 1983 to early 1984 Adventure International employed approximately 50 individuals, and published titles from over 300 independent programmer/authors.

In [[Europe]] the &quot;Adventure International&quot; name was a trading name of [[AdventureSoft]] and other games were released under the name that were not from Adventure International in the [[United States|USA]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arthur C. Clarke.jpg|thumb|200px|Arthur C. Clarke]]

'''Sir Arthur Charles Clarke''' (born [[December 16]] [[1917]]) is the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]] and [[inventor]], most famous for his [[science-fiction]] novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and for collaborating with director [[Stanley Kubrick]] on the film of the same name.  Clarke is considered one of the Big Three of science fiction, along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Isaac Asimov]]; he is the only one still alive. 

==''2001: A Space Odyssey''== was written concurrently with the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film version]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. It was loosely inspired by Clarke's short story &quot;[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]&quot;, but became its own novel while he was collaborating on a screenplay with Kubrick.  Kubrick approached Clarke about writing a novel for the express purpose of making &quot;the proverbial good science-fiction movie&quot;, and the novel was still being written while the film was being made.  This resulted in one of the truly unique collaborations in media history.

Clarke has written numerous other books, including the [[Rendezvous with Rama|Rama]] novels and several sequels to ''2001'', and many short stories, including &quot;[[The Star]]&quot;, about a Jesuit priest's spiritual dilemma.

An [[asteroid]] is named in Clarke's honour, [[4923 Clarke]], as is a species of [[Ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]], ''[[Serendipaceratops arthurcclarkei]]'', discovered in [[Inverloch, Victoria|Inverloch]] in [[Australia]]. The [[2001 Mars Odyssey]] orbiter is named in honor of Sir Arthur's works.

In the [[1940s]] he forecast that man would reach the [[Moon landing|moon]] by the year [[2000]], an idea experts dismissed as rubbish. When [[Neil Armstrong]] landed in [[1969]], the United States said Clarke &quot;provided the essential intellectual drive that led us to the moon.&quot; ([http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=221763+14-Nov-2005+RTRS&amp;srch=clarke] [http://www.taborcommunications.com/archives/3047.html])

He lives in [[Sri Lanka]], and survived the [[tsunami]]s of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], but lost his diving school on [[Hikkaduwa]] ([http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=13638567] [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2004/12/30/latest/20462ArthurC&amp;sec=latest]). Clarke holds citizenship of both the [[UK]] and [[Sri Lanka]] [http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/12/11/new27.html].

==Biography==
Clarke was born in [[Minehead]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], and as a boy enjoyed stargazing and enthusiastically read old American science-fiction magazines (many of which made their way to England as ballast in ships).  After secondary school, and studying at [[Richard Huish College, Taunton]] he was unable to afford a university education and consequently acquired a job as an auditor in the pensions section of the Board of Education.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a [[radar]] specialist and was involved in the early warning radar defense system which contributed to the RAF's success during the [[Battle of Britain]].  He retired in the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]].  After the war, he obtained a first class [[academic degree|degree]] in mathematics and physics at [[King's College London]].

His most important contribution may be the idea that [[geostationary satellite]]s would be ideal [[telecommunication]]s relays. He proposed this concept in a paper titled &quot;[http://www.lsi.usp.br/~rbianchi/clarke/ACC.ETRelaysFull.html Extra-Terrestrial Relays] - Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?&quot;, published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in October [[1945]]. The [[geostationary orbit]] is now sometimes known as the Clarke orbit in his honour.  However, it is not clear that his article was actually the inspiration for modern telecommunications satellites.  [[John R. Pierce]], of [[Bell Labs]], arrived at the idea independently in 1954, and he was actually involved in the [[Echo satellite]] and [[Telstar]] projects. However, Pierce stated that the idea was &quot;in the air&quot; at the time and certain to be developed regardless of Clarke's publication.

Clarke's first professional sale was in [[1946]] to ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', the still memorable short story &quot;Rescue Party&quot;.  Along with his writing, Clarke worked briefly as Assistant Editor of ''[[Science Abstracts]]'' ([[1949]]) before devoting himself to writing full-time from 1951. Clarke also contributed to the ''[[Dan Dare]]'' series and his first three published novels were for a juvenile audience.  He has been chairman of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] and a member of the [[Underwater Explorers Club]]. His work is marked by its optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the solar system and an obvious influence was the work of [[Olaf Stapledon]]. 

In [[1951]], he wrote &quot;The Sentinel&quot; for a [[BBC]] competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only the basis for ''2001'', ''The Sentinel'' introduced a more mystical and cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of ''[[The City and the Stars]]'', ''[[Childhood's End]]'', and the ''2001'' series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution.

He has lived in [[Sri Lanka]] since [[1956]], immigrating when it was still called [[Ceylon]], first in [[Unawatuna]] on the south coast, and then in [[Colombo]]. This inspired the locale for his novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'', in which he describes a [[space elevator]]. This, he figures, will ultimately be his legacy, more so than [[geostationary satellite]]s, once space elevators make space shuttles obsolete.

Early in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the [[paranormal]], and has stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel ''Childhood's End''. He has also said that he was one of several who were fooled by a [[Uri Geller]] demonstration at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. Although he has long since dismissed and distanced himself from nearly all [[pseudoscience]], he still advocates for research into purported instances of [[psychokinesis]] and other similar phenomena.

Following the release of ''2001'', Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the [[Apollo space program]]. He also signed a three-book publishing deal, a record  for a science fiction writer. The first of the three was ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' in [[1973]], which won him all the main genre awards and has spawned sequels that, along with the ''2001'' series, formed the backbone of Clarke's later career.

In [[1975]], his short story ''The Star'' was not included as prose in a new high school [[English Language|English]] textbook in [[Sri Lanka]], because it was felt that it might offend [[Roman Catholics]], although it had been selected. The textbook caused controversy because it replaced [[Shakespeare]]'s work with that of [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Isaac Asimov]].

Clarke is also well known to many for his television programmes ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'' ([[1981]]) and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' ([[1984]]).

In [[1986]], Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially £1,000) for the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] for the best science fiction novel published in Britain in the previous year. In [[2001]] the prize was increased to £2001, and its value now matches the year (i.e., £2005 in [[2005]]).

In [[1988]], he was diagnosed with [[post-polio syndrome]] and has since needed to use a wheelchair.

His [[British honours system|knighthood]] was first announced in [[1998]], but then the British [[tabloid]] ''[[The Daily Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]'' published accusations of [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] against him ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/52598.stm]). The award was delayed while the allegations were investigated, although by [[2000]] the BBC reported that he had been cleared ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/765385.stm]). Clarke's health did not allow him to travel to [[London]] to receive the honour personally from the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], so the UK [[High Commissioner]] to [[Sri Lanka]] awarded him the title of [[Knight Bachelor]] at a ceremony in [[Colombo]].

He is currently the Honorary Board Chair of the [[Institute for Cooperation in Space]], founded by [[Carol Rosin]] and on the [[Board of Governors]] of the [[National Space Society]], a [[space advocacy]] organization originally founded by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]].

He was the first Chancellor of the [[International Space University]], serving from [[1989]] to [[2004]] and Chancellor of [[Moratuwa University]], [[Sri Lanka]], from [[1979]] to [[2002]].

In [[2005]] he lent his name to the first ever annual [http://www.clarkeawards.org Sir Arthur Clarke Awards] - dubbed &quot;the Oscars for Space&quot;.  His brother attended the awards ceremony, and presented an award specially chosen by Arthur (and not by the panel of judges who chose the other awards).

On [[14 November]] [[2005]] Sri Lanka awarded Arthur C. Clarke its highest civilian award, the Lankabhimanaya ''(Pride of Lanka)'' award, for his contributions to science and technology and his commitment to his adopted country.

==Themes, style, and influence==
Clarke's early published stories would usually feature the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough that assists the resolution of a human dilemma. The first manned mission to the moon (''[[Prelude to Space]]''), the colonization of [[Mars]] (''[[The Sands of Mars]]'') and life aboard a space station (''[[Islands in the Sky]]'') were all genre SF mainstays. Clarke's background as a technical writer showed in the early novels as a deliberate documentary style, and his characters reflect Clarke's experience by being mostly  military or civil service types. Despite this, Clarke's style was open to humour and a degree of whimsy which salted its propagandist tone regarding scientific advancement with a sting in the tail.

A recurring type of character is found in ''[[The Lion of Comarre]]'', ''[[The City and the Stars]]'', ''[[The Road to the Sea]]'', and other works. A young man in a superficially [[utopian]] society becomes dissatisfied and restless and seeks to expand his horizons, thereby discovering the underlying decadence of his own society.

''The Sentinel'' introduced a religious theme to Clarke's work. His interest in the paranormal was influenced by [[Charles Fort]] and embraced the belief that mankind may be the property of an ancient alien civilization. Surprisingly for a writer who is often held up as an example of hard science fiction's obsession with technology, three of Clarke's novels have this as a theme.

==The adapted screenplays of Arthur C. Clarke==
===''2001: A Space Odyssey''===  
Clarke's first venture into film was the Stanley Kubrick-directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Kubrick and Clarke had met in [[1964]] to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, it was decided that the story for the film was to be loosely based on Clarke's short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, written in [[1948]] as an entry in a BBC short story competition.  Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but this proved to be more tedious than he had estimated. Instead, Kubrick and Clarke decided it would be best to write a novel first and then adapt it for the film upon its completion. However, as Clarke was finishing the book, the screenplay was also being written simultaneously.

Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of [[1964]] with the plan to publish the novel in [[1965]] in advance of the film's release in [[1966]]. After many delays the film was released in the spring of [[1968]], before the book was completed. It was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation, that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay his authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film is a bold artistic piece with little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of &quot;cause and effect&quot; for the events in the novel. Despite their differences, both film and novel were well received. [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=2001.htm] [http://movies.go.com/moviesdynamic/movies/movie?id=479433] [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Ddvd%2526field-keywords%3Dspace%2520odyssey%2526results-process%3Ddefault%2526dispatch%3Dsearch/ref%3Dpd%5Fsl%5Fov%5Ftops-1%5Fdvd%5F4138659%5F1/104-5000595-8600727]

In [[1972]] Clarke published ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', which included his account of the production and alternate versions of key scenes. The &quot;special edition&quot; of the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)| A Space Odyssey]]'' (released in [[1999]]) contains an introduction by Clarke, documenting his account of the events leading to the release of the novel and film.

===''2010: The Year We Make Contact''===  
In [[1982]] Clarke continued the ''2001'' epic with a sequel, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. This novel was also made into a film, ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'', directed by [[Peter Hyams]] for release in [[1984]]. Due to the political environment in America in the 1980s, the novel and film present a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear war. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as ''2001'', but the reviews were still positive and it has earned over 40 million dollars since its release in North America. [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=2010.htm]

Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984. Titled ''[[The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010]]'', and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film. The book also includes [[Arthur C Clarke's List of the best Science-Fiction films of all time|Clarke's list of the best science-fiction films]] ever made.

===''Rendezvous with Rama''===  
Early in the millennium, actor [[Morgan Freeman]] expressed his desire to produce a film based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel ''Rendezvous with Rama''. The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, [[Revelations Entertainment]].[http://www.revelationsent.com/flash/index.html] Freeman has not given up on the project, but he states that funding for a movie of this type is hard to procure. A popular science-fiction web site (Sci Fi Wire) posted an interview with Freeman about his troubles with the production. [http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-03/14/12.00.film]

==Essays and short stories==
Most of Clarke's essays (between [[1934]] to [[1998]]) can be found in the book ''[[Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!]]'' ([[2000]]). Most of his short stories can be found in the book ''[[The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke]]'' ([[2001]]). They make a good collection of Clarke's non-fiction and fiction works, even for those who already have most of his books. Another collection of early essays was published in ''[[The View from Serendip]]'' ([[1977]]), which also included one short piece of fiction, &quot;[[When the Twerms Came]]&quot;. He has also written short stories under the pseudonyms of [[E. G. O'Brien]] and [[Charles Willis]].

[[Image:Mp2k.gif|right|thumb|The Apple Newton MessagePad 2100, the last model produced.]]

The '''Apple Newton''', or simply '''Newton''', was an early line of [[personal digital assistant]]s developed, manufactured and marketed by [[Apple Computer]] from [[1993]] to [[1998]]. The original Newtons were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor, and featured [[handwriting recognition]]. Apple's official name for the device was ''MessagePad''; the term ''Newton'' was Apple's name for the operating system it used, but popular usage of the word ''Newton'' has grown to include the device and its software together.

== The Newton in development ==

The Newton project was not originally intended to produce a PDA.  The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the &quot;[[personal digital assistant]]&quot; moniker itself was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's then-CEO [[John Sculley]], the driving force behind the project. Newton was, in fact, intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing.  For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and a rich object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating scenarios for the design was known as the &quot;Architect Scenario,&quot; in which Newton's designers imagined a residential architect working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.

For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third &lt;!--exact dates?--&gt;), the project's primary programming language was [[Dylan programming language|Dylan]], a small, efficient [[object-oriented]] [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] variant that still retains some interest. Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time [[dynamic programming language|dynamism]]), Dylan was a tough sell for the large-format Newton (and for a development team unused to Lisp programming). With the move to the smaller form factor, Dylan was relegated to experimental status in the &quot;Bauhaus Project&quot; and eventually cancelled outright.  Had it been retained, Dylan, with [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] and close OS integration, would have preceded Microsoft's [[managed code]] revolution by over a decade.

The project missed by far its original goals to reinvent personal computing, and then to rewrite contemporary application programming. The Newton project's broad vision fell victim to project slippage, [[feature creep]], and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh.

== Technical details ==

Newton used an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] system called [[NewtonScript]], developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]] [http://waltersmith.us/]. One of the major complaints programmers had was that the Toolbox programming environment was overpriced at $1000 (later in the life of the Newton, the programming environment was made available free of charge).  Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.  Despite this, many third party and [[shareware]] applications were (and continue to be) available for Newton.  It has been suggested that the NewtonScript programming system should be made available open-source (as &quot;[[abandonware]]&quot;) but most Newton enthusiasts consider this possibility to be highly unlikely. 

Data in Newton was stored in object-oriented databases known as ''soups.'' One of the revolutionary aspects of Newton was that soups were available to all programs; and programs could operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar could refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad could be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups could be programmer-extended - a new address book enhancement could be built on the data from the existing address book.

While the soup concept worked remarkably well within the Newton system itself, it caused several usability issues.  First, it made it extremely difficult to synchronize data with other systems, like a desktop [[Macintosh]] or [[Personal computer|PC]], making the Newton a [[data island]].  Apple's utility to perform this task, the Newton Connection Utility, was exceedingly complex and was never completed to perform to the satisfaction of most users.  The realization that a handheld computer needed to work within the existing data environment of its users was key to the success of the later [[Palm Pilot]] platform, even though the Palm was technically inferior.

The second consequence of the data-object soup was that objects could extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users could not distinguish which program or add-on object was responsible for the various features on their own system.  A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing.  Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves were tossed in the &quot;Storage&quot; area of the &quot;Extras&quot; drawer.  There was no built-in distinction between types of data in that area.  For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.  There was no easy way to get a listing of all user-installed objects on a system.

Finally, the data soup concept worked well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it worked poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents.  This difficulty in working and sharing data with other systems, stemming from the too revolutionary data-object soup system, was a key contributor to Newton's demise.

Earlier MessagePads used [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]-standard [[serial port]]s - round [[DIN connector|Mini-DIN 8 connector]]s instead of the more common trapezoidal [[D-subminiature|DE-9, commonly called DB-9]]. The 2000/2100 models had a proprietary small flat connector, called an InterConnect port, used with an adapter. In addition, all models had [[infrared]] connectivity.  Unlike the Palm, all MessagePad models were equipped with a standard [[PCMCIA]] expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100).  This allowed native modem and even [[Ethernet]] connectivity; Newton users have also written [[Device_driver|drivers]] for [[802.11b]] wireless networking cards and ATA-type [[flash memory]] cards, a category that includes the popular [[CompactFlash]] format, as well as for [[Bluetooth]] cards. With the 1xx series, an optional keyboard became available, which could also be used via the dongle on a 2x00. Newton could also dial a phone number through the MessagePad speaker, simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker, and fax / email support was built in at the operating system level, although it required external cards. 

The MessagePad 2000 and 2100, with a vastly improved handwriting recognition system, 162MHz [[StrongARM]]SA-110 [[RISC]] processor, Newton 2.1, and a better, clearer, backlit screen, attracted critical plaudits. Although their size and expense were factors which kept them from being as popular as later [[PalmOS]] devices, the Newton still has a small but passionate user base. The final evolution of the Newton's handwriting recognition system is still considered by many to be very impressive, only matched by the more modern [[Tablet PC]] handwriting recognition system.

The MessagePad could be used with the screen turned horizontally (&quot;landscape&quot;) as well as vertically (&quot;portrait&quot;). A change of a setting would instantly rotate the contents of the display by ninety degrees. Handwriting recognition would still work properly with the display rotated.

The use of 4x [[AA]] [[NiCd]] (MessagePad 110, 120 and 130) and 4x AA [[NiMH]] cells (2x00 series, eMate 300) gave a runtime of up to 30 hours (MP 2100 w/ 2x 20 MB linear [[Flash memory]] [[PC Card]]s, no backlight usage) and up to 24 hours with backlight on. While adding more weight to the Newtons than [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]] (as used in the MessagePad and MessagePad 100) or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gave the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the [[Flash memory]] used as internal storage (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the static character of this storage), gave birth to the slogan &quot;Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries&quot;.

Apple and third parties marketed several &quot;wallets&quot; (cases) for the MessagePads, which would hold them securely along with the owner's credit cards, driver's license, business cards, and cash. These wallets were even larger than the MessagePads and even less able to fit in a pocket, so they were most often used as a protective case for the unit to shield it from bumps and scratches.

== Outcome ==

Although the Apple Newton was produced for six years, it was never as successful in the marketplace as Apple had hoped. This has been attributed to two primary reasons: the Newton's high price (which went up to $1000 when models 2000 and 2100 were introduced), and its large size (it failed the &quot;pocket test&quot; by not fitting in an average coat, shirt, or trouser pocket). Critics also panned its [[handwriting recognition]].  These initial problems marred Newton's reputation in the eyes of the public, and PDAs would remain a niche product until [[Palm, Inc.]]'s [[Palm Pilot]], which emerged shortly before the Newton was discontinued.  The Palm Pilot, with its smaller, thinner shape, cheaper cost, and more robust [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] handwriting recognition system - which had been available first as a software package for the Newton - managed to restore the viability of the PDA market after Newton's commercial failure. Ironically, Palm Computing was founded by ex-Apple employee [[Donna Dubinsky]].

The Newton marketing campaign trumpeted the product's handwriting recognition, though in initial versions it was fairly inaccurate. The original handwriting recognition engine was called Calligrapher, and was licensed from a Russian company called Paragraph International. It was actually quite sophisticated; unlike the later Palm Pilot's Graffiti - which made the user learn a new handwriting system and write each letter in an input area - Newton learned the user's natural handwriting, using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing, and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen. Newton could also recognize and clean up simple drawn shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares, and had an intuitive system for handwritten editing, such as scratching out words to be deleted, circling text to be selected, or using written carets to mark inserts. 

Later releases of the Newton operating system retained the original recognizer for compatibility, but added a printed-text recognizer, code-named &quot;[[Rosetta (Newton)|Rosetta]],&quot; which was developed by Apple, included in version 2.0 of the Newton operating system, and refined in Newton 2.1. Rosetta was generally considered a significant improvement and many users consider the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives since.  Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as &quot;1 + 2 =&quot; was also under development but never released. 

The most critical feature of the Newton handwriting recognition system was the modeless error correction. That is, correction done in situation without using a separate window or widget, using a minimum of gestures.  If a word was recognized improperly, the user would simply  double-tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus.  Most of the time, the correct word would be in the list. If not, a button at the bottom of the list allowed the user to edit individual characters in that word.  Error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process, greatly increasing the interruption to a user's workflow that a given correction requires. Excellent handwriting recognition (in OS 2.1 and higher) with smooth, modeless access to robust error correction is quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the device among Newton users.  

Even given the age of the hardware and software, Newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of PDAs produced by other companies.  [[As of 2004]] the Newton 2000 and 2100 can still fetch a price, without accessories, of over $100.

==Later efforts==

Many prototypes of additional Newton models were spotted. Most notable was a Newton tablet or &quot;slate,&quot; a large, flat screen that could be written on. Others included a &quot;Kids Newton&quot; with side handgrips and buttons, &quot;VideoPads&quot; which would have incorporated a video camera and screen on their flip-top covers for two-way communications, the &quot;Mini 2000&quot; which would have been very similar to Palm Pilot, and the &quot;NewtonPhone&quot; (developed by [[Siemens AG]]) which incorporated a handset and a keyboard.

At least one product, the [[eMate 300]] was derived from the Apple Newton, and was offered to schools in 1997 as an inexpensive ($799 US, originally sold to education markets only) and durable computer for classroom use.  However, in order to achieve its low price, the eMate 300 did not have all the features of the contemporary Newton equivalent, the MessagePad 2000 and was cancelled along with the rest of the Newton line.

Before the Newton project was cancelled, it was &quot;spun off&quot; into its own company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when [[Steve Jobs]] ousted Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] and resumed control of Apple. There has since been continual speculation that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm. Apple continues to deny that such a project will ever happen.

The Apple [[Apple iPod | iPod]] is somewhat of a descendant of the Newton in that it is a pocket-sized programmable device based on the ARM processor. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the iPod's OS.

Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the &quot;Print Recognizer&quot; part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X]] version 10.2 (known as &quot;Jaguar&quot;). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as &quot;[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]&quot;, appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. Whether Apple will ever utilize such technology again in a [[handheld device]] remains to be seen.

In June 2004, Apple CEO Steve Jobs indicated that he was proud that Apple resisted pressure to market a new handheld computer. While a small group of Mac faithful consumers have lobbied Apple to sell such a device, the worldwide market for PDAs was in a decline at the time, and Apple chose not to develop the device because demand would have been inadequate.

The NewtonOS was also licensed to a number of third party developers including Sharp and Motorola who developed additional PDA devices that used the operating system.  Motorola added added wireless connectivity to the unit, and renamed it the Marco[http://www.msu.edu/~luckie/gallery/marco.htm].
A possible Newton revival has been a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base; when patents for a tablet based Macintosh were applied for (http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=600), rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new [[Tablet PC]] style Macintosh.

==Appearances in popular culture==

* The Newton was featured in the movie ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory|Under Siege 2]],'' where the main character, played by [[Steven Seagal]], uses it to fax a call for help from a phone on a passenger train.
* In early episodes of the series ''[[The X-Files]]'', the FBI agents use Newtons.
* In the end scene of Larry Laffer ''Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!'' the woman says &quot;I even had a Newton&quot;.
* The character of Kate Libby in ''[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]'' has a MessagePad which is seen in a number of scenes.
* The hacker in the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' has a Newton on his desk.
* [[Gary Sinise]] uses one as the hostage taker in the 1996 film ''Ransom'' starring [[Mel Gibson]].
* Daniel Brühl uses one in the German film ''[[The Edukators]]''.

The handwriting recognition software was ridiculed on several occasions:
* [[Garry Trudeau]] ridiculed it in a series of episodes of his popular comic, ''[[Doonesbury]]''. The last panel of one strip, which shows a character reading the words &quot;egg freckles?&quot; from his Newton [http://images.ucomics.com/comics/db/1993/db930827.gif], became an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in the Newton operating system itself (version 2.0 and earlier). It can be seen by writing the words ''egg freckles'' then highlighting them and tapping the Assist button.
* In an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled &quot;[[Lisa on Ice]]&quot;, which first aired [[November 13]], [[1994]], school bully Kearny has his buddy Daulph take a memo on a Newton.  When Daulph writes &quot;Beat up Martin&quot; on the screen, the handwriting recognition turns it into &quot;Eat up Martha.&quot; Kearny throws the Newton at [[Martin Prince|Martin]] instead. [http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F05.html]
* In 2004, [[CNET]] elected the Apple Newton one of the &quot;Top 10 tech we miss&quot; [http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6259955.html], mentioning the device's amusing willingness to translate nearly any stroke on the screen to text, allowing the user to generate surreal ''Newton Poetry'' from random scribbles.

==Other Uses==
There were a number of projects that used the Newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums. For example, Visible Interactive created a walking tour in San Francisco's Chinatown but the most significant effort took place in Malaysia at the Petronas Discovery Center, known as Petrosains.[http://www.petrosains.com.my/]

In 1995, an exhibit design firm, DMCD Inc. [http://www.dmcd.com]was awarded the contract to design a new 100,000 square foot science museum in the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur. A major factor in the award was the concept that visitors would use a Newton to access additional information, find out where they were in the museum, listen to audio, see animations, control robots and other media, and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit.

The device became known as the ARIF, a Malay word for &quot;wise man&quot; or &quot;seer&quot; and it was also an acronym for A Resourceful Informative Friend. Some 400 ARIFS were installed and over 250 are still in use today.

The development of the ARIF system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers, designers, and writers. The exhibition design and ARIF coordination team was led by Scott Guerin, the hardware/software team by Ted Paschkis, and the writers and interface designers included Paul Trapido and Michael Callan. Mssrs. Guerin and Paschkis went on to found Wivid Systems which specializes in multimedia tour guides for museums. [http://www.wivid.com]

ARIF is an ancestor of the PDA systems used in museums today and it boasted features that have not been attempted since. For example it was used as an exploration tool in a large exhibit about exploring for oil. A visitor's success completing one task influenced the success or failure of a subsequent task. At the conclusion of the exhibit, the ARIF was docked at an IR port where it was used to control a robotic arm that placed equipment at locations influenced by the users previous lessons. In another exhibit, up to eight devices could be used at to activate a 60 foot diameter model of prehistoric Malaysia; volcano eruptions, animal sounds, lighting effects, and wind are among the many effects. This task was accomplished by docking the ARIF at a computer terminal and using it as the input device. There are no touch screens in Petrosains, all interactive systems were controlled by the ARIF.

The Newton was &quot;married&quot; to a primitive packet switching radio system in order to determine its location as the visitor passed through electronic &quot;gateways.&quot; When the visitor entered a new room, the radio triggered an automatic area introduction. The radio also delivered time-synch'd audio in two languages to a group of users when they watched a video.

In addition to being dual language in all audio and text, the ARIF stored bookmarked information such that at the end of the exhibit, users could choose several items of most interest to be printed out, including a souvenir photograph of themselves superimposed on one of several stage sets.

==Jokes==
* A popular [[lightbulb joke]] circled the internet briefly, ostensibly from the [[newsgroup]] comp.sys.newton.misc. 
*: Q: How many Newtons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
*: A: Foux!  There to eat lemons, axe gravy soup.
